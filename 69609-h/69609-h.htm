<h3>THE WAITING BOAT</h3>

<p class='pindent'>One fine evening in the August of the year 1666,
Martin Leake, aged fourteen and a few months, had
strolled down to the riverside for a breath of air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a terribly hot day. The whole month
had been fine and dry; the narrow streets of London
were stuffy and smelly, and it was a relief to escape
from them to the bank of the broad Thames, where
the easterly wind carried in a sharp salt tang from the
sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The river always had a charm for Martin. In those
days it might have been called the main highway of
London City, and he loved to watch the wherries
laden with passengers, and the tall ships lying at
anchor or floating up or down on the tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sauntered on and on, every now and then exchanging
a nod or smile or cheery word with some
waterman he knew. But most of the watermen were
busy on the river, and as the evening went on Martin
met fewer and fewer people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he sat down to rest near the head of a flight
of stairs that led down to the water. A broad stone post
gave support for his back, and leaning against it he
watched the sun sinking into a fiery sky, and the lights
that began to twinkle on the ships moored in the
stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very peaceful. The only sounds that reached
his ears were the plash of oars in passing boats and the
voices of the watermen and their passengers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning to look in the other direction, he noticed for
the first time a ship’s boat straining at her painter,
which was made fast to a ring at the foot of the stairs.
In the boat sat, or rather crouched, a solitary seaman—a
man with a very dark face and long, coal-black
hair. His head was bent forward on his crossed arms;
it seemed that the light rise and fall of the boat on the
tide had rocked him to sleep. He wore a sailor’s long
red cap and an orange-coloured jersey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A waterman passing at the moment stopped and
smiled as he glanced at the slumbering figure. Observing
Martin, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They sleep like cats, these foreigners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a foreigner, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For sure: out of the Portugal ship repairing at
Deptford. Her mizzen-mast, they say, was shot away
by a French privateer nigh the Goodwins. Very bold
these Frenchies are of late, though I did hear as the
Duke of York have give ’em a good drubbing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said Good-night and passed on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All was still again. The glow faded from the sky.
Martin’s eyes were attracted by a three-master that
glided out of the dusk, dropping down with the tide.
He watched her graceful shape threading her way
among the smaller craft on the river, and wondered
where she was bound for, what adventures she would
meet with on her voyage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had almost disappeared when Martin was roused
from his reverie by the sound of footsteps on the
cobbled roadway behind him. Peeping round the
edge of the post, he saw, in the gloom, a man come
forward to the head of the stairs. There he paused and
threw a look round in the manner of a person who is ill
at ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin caught a glimpse of his face, and, with a
start of surprise, shrank back into the shelter of the
post. The man had not seen him. Next moment he
stepped down the stairs, and in a low voice hailed the
seaman slumbering in the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer. The newcomer called again,
more urgently. This time the sailor stirred, straightened
himself, mumbled a reply, and hauling on the painter,
drew the boat alongside the lower stairs. The man
stepped into it, casting another suspicious glance
around as he seated himself on the stern thwart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A word was spoken that Martin did not catch. Then
the seaman cast off, thrust his oars into the rowlocks,
and with long, swinging strokes drove the boat into the
darkness downstream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s Mr. Slocum after?” said Martin to himself
as he got up and started for home.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE SECOND</h1></div>

<h3>MARTIN AT HOME</h3>

<p class='pindent'>And who was Mr. Slocum?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was the only son of a master mariner who,
retiring after many years at sea, had settled in a little
house near the Tower. He had suffered many misfortunes.
Ship after ship in which he had invested his
savings was lost, and the last of them, the <span class='it'>Merry
Maid</span>, sailing from Bristol in the year ’62, had never
been heard of again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen or heard aught of the <span class='it'>Merry
Maid</span>?” was the question the old captain had put to all
seafaring men coming into the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The answer was always the same. Martin often
wondered what had become of the vessel. Many a
time he wished that he could go sailing over the seas to
try to find some trace of her. But when his father and
mother both died of the Plague, he felt bound to stay
on shore and help to look after his little sister Lucy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were left almost destitute, having nothing
except the small sum that was realised by the sale of
Captain Leake’s furniture. This was in the hands of
a lawyer, and as it would bring in only a few shillings
a week, it was clear that Martin would have to earn
something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was taken from St. Paul’s school, and the lawyer
found him a job in the shop of Mr. Greatorex, a wealthy
goldsmith in Cheapside, who had known his father, and
indeed had had an interest in the <span class='it'>Merry Maid</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give the lad a trial,” Mr. Greatorex had said
when the lawyer approached him. “He’ll not get on
very far unless he is apprenticed, of course; but I’m
not inclined to take him as an apprentice without a
premium; at any rate, until I find out the kind of lad
he is. I’ve lost hundreds of pounds in that unlucky
vessel. Let him come and do odd jobs for a while.
Mr. Slocum will tell me how he gets on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had never seen Mr. Greatorex himself. Unlike
most of the city merchants of that day, who lived
over their shops, the goldsmith had built himself a
house in the country, and left his business almost entirely
to Mr. Slocum, his manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were three apprentices who lived in the house,
two of them sleeping under the shop counter. They
rather despised the new boy. Martin had to come
early in the morning to take down the shutters and
sweep out the shop. All day he was running errands
between the shop and the workrooms in Foster Lane,
or carrying parcels to customers, or fetching things for
Mr. Slocum and the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the close of business he had to put up the shutters,
and was often very tired by the time he reached home.
At first one or two of the apprentices were inclined to
bully him, but he showed himself to have plenty of
spirit and a neat way with his fists, and his tormentors
soon learnt to leave him alone. But his life was a hard
one. Mr. Slocum was ill-tempered, and nothing but
Martin’s care for his sister kept him from running away
to sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the way home Martin puzzled about Mr. Slocum’s
journey down the river in the foreign boat. The apprentices
talked among themselves about their
master, and Martin knew that he often went out at
night, not returning until very late. He was late also
in the morning, except when Mr. Greatorex was
expected to ride in from the country. And his temper
seemed to grow worse every day. He barked at the
apprentices like an angry dog, and if they or Martin
committed the slightest fault, they had learnt to
expect a thrashing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house where Martin lived was a large old building
that stood by itself some distance from the riverside.
It had once been the mansion of a nobleman, but of
late years it had been let out in tenements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basement was occupied by an old seaman named
Dick Gollop and his wife. Gollop had served under
Captain Leake in many a voyage, and retired at the
same time, obtaining employment as a constable. His
thick round figure and bandy legs were well known
along the waterside, and he was so good-tempered that
the small boys of the neighbourhood liked to go with
him on his rounds, and beg him to tell them a story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Martin and his sister were left homeless it was
arranged that they should live with the Gollops, the
lawyer paying a small sum weekly for their board and
lodging. Martin slept in a small parlour at the back,
and Lucy in a slip room. They had their meals with
the constable and his wife, whose tongue was sometimes
rather sharp, but whose heart was kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re late to-night, young master,” said Susan
Gollop as Martin entered the kitchen. Supper was on the
table, and Lucy had already begun her meal. Gollop
was not present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look what I’ve got,” said the little girl, holding up
a cake of hardbake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, the Mounseer gentleman will spoil you, that
he will,” said Susan. “I never liked foreigners, but the
Mounseer has a kind heart, and he has took to you
most uncommon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mounseer was an old French gentleman who had
fled from persecution in France a few years before, and
now occupied the first floor of the Gollops’ house. He
had struck up a friendship with Lucy, and regularly
every day escorted her to and from the dame’s school
she attended about a mile away. Mrs. Gollop was glad
to earn a little every week for looking after his room
and his clothes; but he bought his own food and did
himself what little cooking he needed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what do you think?” Susan went on. “The
second floor is let at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad of that,” said Martin. “You’ll get more
money now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I might,” said the old woman. “But the
new gentleman will do for himself. He’s a nice, fair-spoken
gentleman, I will say that, Seymour by name,
and I wonder at him making his own bed and dusting
and all that. But there, I suppose he knows his own
business; it’s not for me to say; only I would have liked
to make a shilling or two extra doing for him as I did
for the lodger what’s gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment heavy footsteps were heard clumping
down the stone stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s my old man,” said Susan, going to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fine night, my hearties,” said the constable as he
came in. “And plaguey hot. Never did I know a
summer as dry as this. Give me a drink, Sue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hung his three-cornered hat on a peg, threw his
staff into a corner, stripped off his long coat, and rolled
up his shirt sleeves. His broad red face beamed as he
sat down to his simple supper of bread and cheese and
beer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, young master, what’s your own news to-day?”
he said to Martin. “Have you been conveying
gold and silver about the city? When I think of the
watches and the goblets and the golden rings you
carry on you, I wonder to myself whether, being a
constable, I oughtn’t to go with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t done much of that to-day,” said Martin.
“I had to fetch some tobacco for Mr. Slocum—ah, I
must tell you! I was down by the river just now, and I
saw Mr. Slocum get into a boat with a foreign sailor,
from a Portugal ship, I was told.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s not a wonderful bit of news to tell the
Lord Mayor about. These warm nights many folks like
a row on the river. It freshens ’em up and helps ’em to
sleep. I reckon all the watermen were busy, and Mr.
Slocum took the first boat that was handy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so. The boat seemed to be waiting
for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he had business with the master of the
Portugal ship—a matter of earrings for the crew,
belike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he came down in a sneaking sort of way, as if
he didn’t want to be seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steady, my lad; don’t you go for to be too sharp,
getting fancies into your head. It’s none of your
business, what Mr. Slocum does; and if he didn’t
wish to be seen, he won’t thank you for talking
about it. So take my advice and keep your mouth
shut.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE THIRD</h1></div>

<h3>THE ASSAULT</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Next day, when Martin was preparing to put up the
shutters of the shop in Cheapside, Mr. Slocum called
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, you Leake, you’re not to go home yet.
There’s a parcel to be taken to an address in Middle
Temple Lane. It must go without fail this evening, and
you’ll have to wait for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, sir,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And on your way you can leave a letter in
Whitefriars. That will save a special journey. Don’t
loiter, mind. You’ll take a receipt for the parcel, and
give it to me to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was a little annoyed at being kept late, as he
had promised to take Lucy on the river. But there
was no help for it. He closed the shop, then went to
the workrooms in Foster Lane, where the parcel would
be made up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only one workman was there at his bench, giving the
final polish to a goblet of silver-gilt. He appeared to
Martin to dawdle over his job, and it was nearly dark
before the parcel was ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin set off with it, going through St. Paul’s
Churchyard and down Ludgate Hill. Then he turned
to the left, towards the maze of lanes and alleys that
constituted the district of Whitefriars. It was at a
house in one of these lanes that he had to deliver the
letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked quickly, for it was an unsavoury neighbourhood.
Many of the houses were old and tumble-down;
many of the people who lived in them were bad
characters; and Martin, knowing that the parcel he
carried was valuable, wished that he could have
taken it by the more direct and open route along
Fleet Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was already so dark that he had some difficulty in
finding the house at which the letter was to be delivered.
In those days houses were not numbered;
some were distinguished by signs that hung over the
doorways, others had no distinguishing marks at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The address on Martin’s letter ran: “To Mr. Mumford,
at his house over against the Golden Fleece
Tavern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After making some inquiries, Martin discovered the
house where Mr. Mumford lived, and rapped on the
door. A window opened, and a hoarse voice asked,
“Who’s there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A letter from Mr. Slocum,” Martin replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments afterwards the door was opened, and
a rough-looking man, holding a candle, gave a hard
look at Martin as he took the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; no answer,” he said, without breaking
the seal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin hurried away, wondering how the man knew
there was no answer before he had read the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had got about half-way to his destination in
Middle Temple Lane when two men rushed suddenly
out of a narrow doorway and almost knocked him
down. As he staggered, he felt a tug at the parcel he
carried under his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tightening his grip upon it, he drew himself away, but
next moment a sharp blow behind his knees threw him
to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s under him; quick about it,” said a hoarse voice
very much like Mr. Mumford’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had fallen on the parcel. He realised now
that the men were trying to steal it, and he grasped it
with both arms, and called aloud for help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the men instantly clapped his hand over
Martin’s mouth, while the other sought to wrench the
parcel from his clinging arms. He kicked out with his
feet, pressed with all his weight upon the parcel, and
desperately resisted the man’s attempt to turn him
over on his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his assailant was a man of brawn. The struggle
was hopeless. As Martin was heaved violently over,
his mouth was released for a moment from the clutching
hand, and he let out a piercing cry. A heavy shoe
kicked him; once more he was stifled; but his cry had
been heard; there was an answering shout and the
clatter of feet on the cobblestones down the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ruffians made one more attempt to wrest the
parcel away. Failing, they kicked him again, and
made off just in time to escape the sturdy watermen
who had rushed to the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s young Master Leake,” said one of them,
lifting him from the ground. “What’s amiss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bruised and breathless, Martin told his story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They didn’t get my parcel,” he concluded. “But
it’s ruined, crushed; look at it. It’s no good my going
on. I must take it back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we’ll see you safe,” said the watermen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Escorted by his rescuers, Martin returned to the
shop in Cheapside, and gave the parcel into the hands
of the housekeeper. Then, his aching body supported
between his two friends, he walked slowly homeward.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE FOURTH</h1></div>

<h3>MARTIN LOSES HIS JOB</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The moment Martin entered the shop next day Mr.
Slocum pounced on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, you Leake, come here,” he cried. “What
do you mean by it? What have you got to say for
yourself, eh? A pretty messenger you are! Look at
this goblet; scratched, dented, absolutely ruined!
Who’s to pay for the damage? Tell me that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly I am sorry, sir,” said Martin; “but it was
not my fault. I was set upon and knocked down by
two ruffians. But for some watermen who came up I
should have lost the goblet altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watermen, you say. Did they chase the footpads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir; the men ran away at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d know them again, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid not. It was nearly dark, and they
attacked me so suddenly that I hadn’t time to get
much of a look at them. But I did see that one of them
had a big scar across his forehead, just above the eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where did this happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little way beyond Mr. Mumford’s, sir, just after
I had given him your letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you mean to tell me you were stupid enough to
carry a costly goblet into that nest of rogues?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me to, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, sir, you said I was to take Mr. Mumford’s
letter on my way, and that meant——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t contradict me! You were a careless young
dog; went meandering along, I dare say, with your
nose in the air and your eyes on the stars. You are not
to be trusted. If anything of the sort happens again,
you and I will say good-bye, Master Leake. Get
your broom and sweep the floor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Slocum went to his little room at the back, and
Martin set about his work, smarting under a sense of
injustice. He had simply done as he was told, and it
was unfair to be blamed for what could not have been
foreseen. Who would have guessed that anyone would
attack a boy carrying a small parcel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>To add to his annoyance, the ’prentices began to
bait him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A likely story,” said one. “You made it all up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course he did,” said another. “Butter-fingers!
Dropped the parcel; a horse gave it a kick, and he tells
this cock-and-bull story to explain the damage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin went on sweeping, saying nothing, though
his ears began to burn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at him blushing,” jeered the first. “His
name ought to be Molly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin threw down his broom and sprang at his
tormentor, a big, hulking fellow half a head taller.
They grappled; Martin wrenched himself out of the
other’s grip and rushed at him with clenched fists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fought almost without sound, fearing to draw
Mr. Slocum from his den. The ’prentice was content at
first to ward off the blows that Martin rained on him,
and the scornful smile on his face only fed the smaller
boy’s rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So intent were they upon the fight that neither
noticed the entry of a well-dressed elderly gentleman.
He stood looking on with a smile until, scuffling and
swaying, the boys lurched against him, the ’prentice
treading on his toes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment Mr. Slocum came out of his room
and, rushing down the shop, gave Martin a smart clout
on the side of his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg a thousand pardons, sir,” he said to the
customer. “This is a troublesome young rascal; I have
already had to admonish him this morning, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s nothing, Mr. Slocum!” said the gentleman,
smiling. “Boys will be boys. I admire the youngster’s
pluck, and as for your admonishments, I fancy they
are due rather to the other for fighting one so much
smaller than himself. Besides, the lout trod on my
toes, confound him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am shocked, sir, deeply pained,” said Mr.
Slocum, glaring at the two boys. “Get away to your
work; I will deal with you presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin could not help watching the pleasant red-faced
gentleman who had taken his part. He noticed
how humble Mr. Slocum’s attitude was to the customer,
and how respectfully he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder who he is?” Martin thought, and the
gentleman’s features remained fixed in his memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the customer had finished his business and
departed, Mr. Slocum turned to Martin and, speaking
in his usual harsh, overbearing way, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You disgrace this establishment! Mind you this:
if I catch you fighting here again I shall dismiss you on
the spot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin made no protest, but he felt the injustice of
his employer’s treatment, and wished more than ever
that he was free to find a place as ship’s boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very next day matters came to a head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in the afternoon Martin was surprised to see
enter the shop the old Frenchman who lived above the
Gollops. At the moment he was polishing some
silver plate in the back premises, along with two of the
’prentices. The third was behind the counter, and the
Frenchman asked him, in his queer broken English, if
he might see Mr. Slocum.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/img-019.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0003' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The ’prentice went into Mr. Slocum’s office, and,
returning in a few moments, bade the visitor, not too
politely, to follow him. The door of the office was
closed behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s old Froggy want now?” said one of the
’prentices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin looked at the speaker in surprise. He had
not himself seen Mounseer in the shop before, but
evidently this was not his first visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to know,” replied his opponent of the
previous day. “I wonder he dares to show himself in
a respectable shop. His clothes aren’t fit for a scarecrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin flushed. The Frenchman was his friend, a
kindly, courteous, dignified gentleman, and he disliked
to hear him criticised. It was true, Martin had to
admit, now that his attention had been called to him,
that his clothes were shabby; but they were well made,
and of good quality. For the first time Martin asked
himself whether the old man was very poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder where he lives,” the first ’prentice went
on. “He’s never had anything sent home, has he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that I know of,” was the answer. “I dare
say he lives in some filthy cellar and feeds on rats and
mice. He’s come a-begging, I should think; but he
won’t get much out of old Slocum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had been growing more and more indignant,
and could remain silent no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me tell you the French gentleman is a friend of
mine, and lives in my house,” he blurted out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, indeed! A friend of yours, is he? And you and
he live in the same cellar, I suppose, and share the
vermin? I’m not surprised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t live in a cellar. You’d better say no
more about him; I won’t stand it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say what I like without asking you. He’s a
miserable old scarecrow of a foreigner, and we don’t
want people like him in London. He would make a
good guy for the Fifth of November. I’d like to light
some crackers under him and see him jump.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was more than Martin could stand. Dropping
the salver he was polishing, he rushed at the ’prentice
with such impetuosity that the boy lost his balance and
fell. Up again in an instant, he closed with Martin,
and, forgetting everything else, the two began to
fight in the narrow space behind the counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out!” warned the ’prentice looking on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the warning came too late. They lurched
against one of the glass-cases containing jewellery.
There was a crash. Splinters of glass fell all about the
floor, the door of Mr. Slocum’s den flew open, and Mr.
Slocum himself, pale with anger, dashed out, followed
by the old Frenchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You again, you young villain!” roared the goldsmith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught Martin by the ear, lugged him to the door,
and shot him into the street with a parting kick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you dare to show your face here again,” he
cried, “or I’ll thrash you black and blue.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE FIFTH</h1></div>

<h3>THE NOISE IN THE NIGHT</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Martin picked himself up, rubbed the mud from his
clothes, and without giving another look at Mr.
Slocum or the shop, set off on the way home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad to be out of it,” he thought; “but what
shall I do now to earn some money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had taken only a few steps when he heard his
name called from behind. Turning, he saw Mounseer
hurrying after him, and stood still until the Frenchman
had caught him up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see it,” said the old gentleman. “I ask, what is
the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am dismissed, sir; that is all,” Martin replied, as
they walked on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dismissed! But yes; does the Englishman dismiss
with violence? I do not understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Slocum was angry. I was fighting one of the
’prentices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, ah, fighting; what you call the box,” said the
Frenchman, smiling. “That is what the English like,
I think. It is not then a reason to dismiss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fought yesterday, and Mr. Slocum threatened to
dismiss me if I did it again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! That is another thing. To fight once, yes; but
to fight a second time when the master forbids, that is
disobedience, also it is folly. What was the subject of
the quarrel? I may ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fellow was saying things about——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin pulled himself up. He could not hurt the old
gentleman’s feelings by repeating the ill-natured
sneers at his appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not tell, eh? Well, I ask no more. You are
young, Martin; as you grow older you will know that
fighting is not for always; you must choose the proper
time. Without doubt, Mr. Slocum is a hard man; but
it is reasonable he think his place of business is not the
right place, nor the hours of business the right time, for
the practice of the box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin ruefully agreed that his friend was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But come, then,” Mounseer went on, noticing his
downcast look. “Do not be down in dumps; that is
what you say, eh? To fight is no disgrace, if the cause is
good. To be dismissed, that is bad, certainly; but I
think you will soon find other employment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman’s confidence was not shared by
Dick Gollop and his wife when Martin explained the
reason of his early return. In applying for a new
situation he would need a reference, and it would be
hopeless to look for a recommendation from Mr.
Slocum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I say is, go straight to Mr. Greatorex,” said
Susan. “That Slocum is a wicked tyrant, that’s
what he is, and Mr. Greatorex ought to know about
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, Sue!” said her husband. “The boy
disobeyed orders; that’s mutiny, and Mr. Greatorex
wouldn’t override his manager. Martin won’t tell
what he was fighting about, but says he isn’t ashamed
of it. There’s a mystery somewhere, and I don’t like it.
He must look for another job, and I hope he’ll get one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Late that night, when Dick Gollop was out on his
round as constable, and Lucy had gone to bed, Susan
was stitching a rent in one of Mounseer’s shirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! That’s done at last,” she said. “ ’Tis
time Mounseer had a new shirt, I’m thinking. Deary
me! I’m tired out after working all this broiling hot
day, and I’m sure I don’t want to climb those stairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me take it up,” said Martin. “I’ll save your
legs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s kind of you. I promised the old gentleman
he should have it to-night, or I wouldn’t trouble
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin took the shirt and left the room. The staircase
was very dark, and he walked up slowly, feeling
his way along the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he was about half-way up he heard a creaking
on the landing above, opposite the Frenchman’s door.
He halted, and, supposing that Mounseer himself had
come out of his room to ask for his shirt, he was on the
point of calling to him when he caught the sound of
hurried but soft footfalls on the stairs higher up, and
then of a door gently closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on again, reached Mounseer’s door, and
knocked. At first there was no answer; but after
knocking a second time he heard the sound of flint and
steel in the room within, then a voice asking who was
there, and at last a fumbling with the bolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! It is you, my young friend, with my shirt,”
said the old gentleman, opening the door. “I had fallen
asleep, and had to light my candle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I heard you on the stairs, sir,” said
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no! I have not left my room. It is late, and
time for your bed. Good-night. A thousand thanks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin returned to the basement, bade good-night to
Susan, and went to bed. But he found it impossible to
sleep. He lay tossing on his bed, worrying about the
future, listening to the church clocks striking the
hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was some time after midnight when the stillness
was broken by what seemed to be a low whistle from
the patch of waste ground outside and a little above
Martin’s window. The sound was not repeated, and
Martin almost believed he was mistaken; but a few
seconds later he was roused by another sound; a slight
creaking, as if a window somewhere had been opened,
then closed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On so hot a night anyone might open a window for
air. It was the closing, after the whistle, that caused
Martin to get up, go to his window and look out upon
the waste ground. No one was in sight. There were no
more sounds, and Martin went back to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as he was at last dozing off to sleep he was
roused by a slight sound in the house. In old buildings
the stairs often creak without apparent cause, and
Martin was not startled or disturbed. But a minute or
two later he heard a louder sound, like wood breaking,
and then shouts and the stamping of heavy feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Springing out of bed he rushed into the passage and
up the stairs as quickly as he could in the dark. The
noise appeared to be coming from the neighbourhood
of Mounseer’s room. When he reached the landing he was
hurled back against the wall by the impact of a heavy
figure that seemed to have come through the open door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he could recover his footing he heard someone
stumbling down the stairs. He darted to the
banisters and was just able to see a dark form rush
along the passage and through the front door, which he
banged after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it? What ever is it?” cried Susan from
the door of her room. Lucy shrieked with alarm and
fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry,” Martin called. “He has gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went into the Frenchman’s room, and by the
faint starlight he saw a scene that surprised him. In
the middle of the floor stood the old gentleman,
rapier in hand, his coat wrapped round his left arm,
as duellists were accustomed to wear their cloaks. A
chair was overturned, and there was broken wood
near the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is you, my young friend,” said the Frenchman,
dropping his point. “Be good enough to light my
candle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Martin did this, Mounseer stood on guard,
watching the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will not come back, I think,” he said. “I was
disturbed by a sound outside my door; I sleep lightly,
like all who have followed campaigns, and I had time to
rise and seize my rapier before the bolt was forced and
that wretch broke in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was he, sir?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I know not,” was the reply. “But he will
remember me,” he added with a chuckle. “I felt my
point get home, and the wretch was only saved because,
as I pressed him, I stumbled over my chair.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But,
pardon, monsieur, I did not observe you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the doorway stood a tall man in a dressing-gown,
his close-cropped poll and blue shaven cheeks
giving him a strange appearance in the candlelight.
It was Mr. Seymour, the new lodger who had recently
taken the top floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not intrude, sir,” said the newcomer
politely, “but I heard the noise, and came to give
neighbourly assistance if it were needed. I see that it
was not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mounseer bowed without saying anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am vastly relieved, sir,” Mr. Seymour went on.
“Such an attack might have been dangerous to one
of your years. The city is infested with rogues, but
one might expect to be safe with a constable in the
house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The constable is not in the house at night, sir,”
said the Frenchman drily. “I thank you for your
benevolent intention; the danger is past, and I would
not keep you from your bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His bow as he said this could only be taken as a
courteous dismissal, and Mr. Seymour bowed himself
out. Martin guessed from the expression of Mounseer’s
face that he did not like his neighbour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, my friend Martin, please me by returning to
your bed,” said the old gentleman. “I will barricade
my door; they will not disturb me again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin heard the clocks strike two before he fell
asleep. And it was only in his last waking moment
that he remembered having heard creaking stairs
earlier that night near Mounseer’s room.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE SIXTH</h1></div>

<h3>MARTIN’S PASSENGER</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Martin spent all the next day in a fruitless search for
work. Either no one wanted a boy, or the few that
had places open would not engage a boy who had
been dismissed for fighting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening, tired and dejected, Martin was
walking homeward along the waterside. Glancing
towards the stairs where he had seen Mr. Slocum embark
on the foreigner’s boat, he noticed two small
boys bending down over a boat that was moored to an
iron ring. A third boy stood half-way up the stairs,
evidently keeping watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Martin was still some distance off, the two
boys rose and ran up to their companion, smiling and
pointing. Then all three climbed the remaining steps
and darted away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin could not help smiling at the mischievous
little fellows. They had untied the painter, and set the
boat adrift on the stream. It was now floating down
on the swift-running tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time it came opposite Martin it was already a
dozen yards from the shore. To his surprise he saw
that it was not empty, as he had supposed. In the
bottom lay a dark bearded man with a red cap and an
orange jersey—the same man as Martin had seen at the
same spot two or three days before. He was fast asleep,
just as he had been then. Neither the action of the
mischievous boys nor the motion of the stream had
awakened him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi! hi!” shouted Martin, fearing that the man might
come to grief if the boat struck against some larger
vessel lower down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his cries did not awaken the sleeper, and Martin
ran on to the stairs; there was usually a boat belonging
to one of his watermen friends moored on the farther
side; he would put off in her and catch up with the
drifting boat before she came to harm. But there was
no boat at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, never mind,” said Martin to himself. “I
can’t help the sleepy-head. I dare say he’ll be seen
from some wherry or lighter. How strange that he
should be here again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down with his back against the stone post,
and idly watched the boat as it rapidly drifted downstream.
In a few minutes two men came from behind
the head of the stairs, and grumbled at the absence of
the watermen. Then one appeared, rowing his wherry
from the opposite shore. The men hailed him; he
pulled in to the foot of the stairs, took on the impatient
passengers, and rowed away again, towards the
city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dusk was gathering, and Martin was about to
rise and go home when he heard footsteps on the
other side of him, and a voice say, angrily,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boat is not here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t wait,” said another voice, which Martin
recognised at once as Mr. Slocum’s. Instinctively he
drew farther back into the shadow of the post. “It
would not be safe. You must hire a waterman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t one to be seen,” said the first speaker.
“There never is when you want one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt one will come in a minute or two,” said
Mr. Slocum. “Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speaker had been hidden from Martin by the
post. He heard Mr. Slocum hurry away; then the
other man came in sight and walked down the steps.
Under his arm he carried a small box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Slocum here again,” thought Martin. “It’s
very strange.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was now so much interested that he decided to
wait and see what happened. The man was tall and
swarthy, with a big red nose, and a beard as black as
the foreign seaman’s. As he sat on the stairs he
muttered to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while a heavily-laden wherry approached
from upstream. It contained several passengers,
laughing and singing noisily, and when they disembarked
and mounted the stairs Martin saw that they
carried baskets, and guessed that they were picknickers
returning from a jaunt to Chelsea or Battersea. The
waterman was Jack Boulter, a friend of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiting stranger called to Boulter, demanding to
be taken to Deptford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not me; not to-night,” said the waterman. “I’ve
been out all day. I’m going home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must take me, I say,” the stranger
protested. He raised his voice, and Martin was
surprised at a change in his accent. With Mr. Slocum
he had spoken like an Englishman, but now his
utterance was exactly that of a foreigner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you say don’t matter,” returned Boulter,
proceeding to tie up his boat. “I won’t stir out again
for no man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger began to plead and coax and threaten,
but to all his excited words Boulter turned a deaf ear.
Some impulse prompted Martin to rise and walk
down to the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Boulter, let me take him to Deptford,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s you, young master,” said Boulter. “Well,
you’ve rowed my wherry time and again, and I don’t
mind if you do, so long as you promise to tie her up
when you get back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! You are kind. You are a friend,” said the
foreigner. He produced a shilling, and was handing it
to Martin when Boulter reached forward and took the
coin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank’ee,” he said. “Young master will take ’ee
quite safe, and I’ll get along to the Pig and Whistle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another minute Martin was pulling the wherry
out into mid-stream. The passenger sat in silence upon
the stern thwart, still grasping his box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was now little traffic on the river. Here and
there near the banks barges were moored, and the
spars of larger vessels were outlined against the
glooming sky. Glancing frequently over his shoulder
Martin steered a course clear of obstructions, and in no
long time came within sight of the Deptford shipyards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the passenger, who had not spoken a word,
motioned Martin to land him at a jetty jutting out
from a quay along the wall of a house overhanging the
river. It had the appearance of an empty warehouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was pulling round when the man changed
his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not there,” he said. “Beyond; farther: at the
stairs of Deptford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin sculled on, feeling that there was something
mysterious about his passenger. He seemed anxious,
or excited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wherry was almost opposite to the Deptford
stairs when a cry broke from the passenger’s lips.
Martin glanced round, and saw a boat approaching
swiftly. It contained a single man, pulling hard
against the tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s passenger stood up, and shouted angrily a
few words in a foreign tongue, which Martin could not
understand. The man ceased rowing, and turned his
head, and Martin recognised him as the foreign seaman
whom he had seen a little while before asleep in the
drifting craft. Next moment he swung his boat round
and rowed rapidly towards the entrance of the repairing
yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later Martin landed his passenger at
the foot of the stairs. The man seemed to be in too
great a hurry even to thank him. He sped up the stairs
and disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have a little rest before I go back,” thought
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tied up the boat and strolled along by the edge of
the repairing dock. Only one vessel lay there, a three-master
brig without her mainmast, and it flashed into
Martin’s memory that the waterman had told him of a
Portugal ship that had come in for repairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that a Portugal vessel?” he asked a man who
was lounging near by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, Portugal she is,” was the reply. “Dismasted
by a Frenchman in the Channel. She’s not so foreign-looking
as some Portugal ships I’ve seen, but her crew—why,
bless your life, they’re as pretty a set of cut-throats
as you’ve ever set eyes on.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE SEVENTH</h1></div>

<h3>A BLOW IN THE DARK</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Martin found himself to be taking a rather unusual
interest in this Portugal ship. It was impossible in the
dusk to see her lines clearly; indeed, she was lying so
low in the dock that even in the daylight one could not
have obtained a good view of her. And the shipwrights’
work being over for the day, there was nothing
going on upon her deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What interested Martin was not so much the vessel
herself as the persons with whom she seemed to be
connected. There was the foreign seaman whom he
had twice seen waiting at the foot of the stairs. There was
Mr. Slocum, who had embarked on that seaman’s boat.
And now there was this third man, who had come with
Mr. Slocum to the stairs, who spoke like an Englishman
and also like a foreigner, and who was evidently
very well known to the sleepy-headed seaman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s some mystery about all this,” Martin said
to himself. “Mr. Slocum said it wasn’t safe for him
to wait about at the stairs. Why? What reason
can he have for coming or sending to this Portugal ship
at all? Has she jewels or plate among her cargo,
and he’s buying them? But why should he do it
secretly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quite clear that he would not get answers to
his questions by staring at the vessel. Two or three
swarthy men in outlandish costumes were now moving
about the deck: he heard their strange voices, so
unlike the sing-song of English sailors. The lighting of
a lamp reminded him that black night would soon lie
upon the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s time to be off,” he thought, and, turning
about, he walked back without hurry to his boat,
cast her off, and began to pull out into mid-stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tide was now slack, just on the turn, and he
was glad that he would not have to row against the
current.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had taken no more than half a dozen strokes
when the silence was broken by loud shouts from the
direction of the repairing yard. Turning his head, he
saw a small figure in the act of diving into the river
from a little jetty at the angle of the yard, and
behind him a number of much taller forms rushing
along as if in pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was so nearly dark that all these figures were only
just visible. But in a moment Martin was able to see
a black head and two splashing arms on the surface of
the water. The swimmer was making straight across
towards the opposite bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was seen also by the men on the jetty. With
cries of excitement they dashed back to the shore,
and ran towards a boat that was drawn up on the
mud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had ceased rowing; his interest in the
Portugal ship was whetted anew, for surely those
excitable men were foreigners from that vessel. Who
was the fugitive?</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he rested on his oars he noticed that the swimmer
had suddenly changed his course, and was coming
with swift over-hand strokes straight for the boat.
Meanwhile, the pursuers had hauled their boat off the
mud, got afloat, and were now pulling hard in the
same direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin felt a throb of excitement as he watched the
chase. By this time he realised that the fugitive was
swimming to him for help, and he checked the motion
of his boat, which had been drifting slowly on the
turning tide, and edged it towards the swimmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next moment a hand shot out of the water and
grasped the gunwale. The second hand followed. Then
a husky, spluttering voice whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take me in, quick! They will catch me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was thrilled when he saw that the speaker
was a boy, a little younger than himself, as he guessed.
Without reasoning, acting on a natural impulse, he
shipped his oars, and trimming the boat as well as he
could by lying across it, managed with some difficulty
to help the little fellow to clamber in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick! They will catch me,” gasped the boy
again as he sank exhausted into the bottom of the
boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment Martin had the oars in the rowlocks and
began to pull with all his strength. He caught sight of
the pursuing boat forging out of the darkness, and the
shouts of the men aboard her told him that they had
seen what had happened to the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spurred on by the angry menace of their voices, he
bent to his oars with a will. He had seen a look of
terror in the boy’s eyes as he climbed into the boat,
and afterwards he remembered, what he had not
consciously observed at the time, that the boy’s skin
was dark, though his features were not those of a
Negro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martin did not look at the boy as he lay in the
boat. His whole attention was concentrated on the
pursuers. His heart sank; they were gaining on him.
How could it be otherwise? The Thames wherry of
those days was a heavy lumbering craft, and a half-grown
boy could not hope to outrow the two men who
were urging their boat along with strong, sweeping
strokes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard encouraging cries from the third man who
sat in the stern, and as the pursuing boat gained on
him yard by yard, he saw with a strange thrill, in
spite of the darkness, that this man was the mysterious
bearded passenger whom he had rowed down the river
an hour before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without knowing why, this recognition urged him
to still greater exertions. But the strain was telling
upon his muscles; already they were aching almost to
numbness. Yet he rowed on and on, doggedly, not
dropping his sculls until the other boat sheered up
alongside, and one of the men, swinging round the butt
of his oar, dealt Martin a blow that sent him backward
off his thwart. His head struck the thwart behind, and
he lay doubled up between the two, stunned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long he remained thus he never knew. When
he came to himself, conscious of a stiff back and an
aching head, and raised himself, he found that he was
alone in the boat, which was drifting towards the
mud flats on the Surrey shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked around; the other boat, the fugitive boy,
the pursuers, all had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where am I?” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were few lights on the banks; in the darkness
he could not recognise his whereabouts. Seizing his
sculls, he rowed slowly, painfully, across the stream
towards the northern shore. Presently, in the distance,
he caught sight of dim lights stretching across the river,
and knew that they shone from the houses on London
Bridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a sigh he swung the boat about, and pulled
still more slowly against the running tide, keeping
close to the shore. It seemed hours before he came to
the well-known stairs. He tied up the boat and then
deliberated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I go and tell Boulter what’s happened?
He’ll be at the Pig and Whistle: I’d better go home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dragging himself along, more distressed at his
failure to save the boy than at his own injuries, he
reached his house, groped stumblingly down the dark
stairs, and found Susan Gollop placidly knitting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sakes alive, what’s come to you?” she cried,
as the candlelight fell upon his pale face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve hurt my head,” he replied, dropping into a
chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! If my thumbs didn’t prick!” she exclaimed.
“I knew something had happened to you, you’re so
late. I said to Gollop: ‘That boy’s got into mischief,
and you can’t deny it.’ Now just you sit still and let
me look at the place and tell me all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good woman lifted his hair gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious me! A lump as big as a duck’s egg,” she
cried. “You’ve been fighting again, I’ll be bound,
though I’d have thought——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a goose, Susan,” Martin interrupted. “If
I’d fought, the bump would have been in front. I was
hit a foul blow, and I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan Gollop was more tender in action than in
speech. She bathed the wounded head and bound it
up with a strip of linen, while Martin recounted the
events of the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, dear! Well, I’m sure! Poor little boy! Oh,
the wretch!” she exclaimed at points of the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I never did hear the like,” she said at the end.
“That Slocum: it’s my belief he’s doing something
he’s ashamed of, or ought to be, drat him! It’s a
mercy you don’t work for him any more. And the
other man; would you know him again? For you
must tell Gollop all about it, and he’ll take the wretch
up and see what the magistrates have to say to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’d know him again,” Martin replied. “I
couldn’t forget his big red nose and his beard as black
as your saucepan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s strange,” said the woman thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s strange?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, if I didn’t see just such a one this very day!
Ay, and in this very street. He passed me as I came
back from shopping! ‘That’s a red coal in a black
grate,’ thinks I, and indeed he was a fearsome-looking
creature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what he was doing about here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Who knows? But don’t bother your head
about him any more. Get you to your bed, and I hope
the bump’ll be flatter by the morning.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE EIGHTH</h1></div>

<h3>THE FACE AT THE WINDOW</h3>

<p class='pindent'>At breakfast next morning Martin expected to have
to tell his story over again to Dick Gollop, who had
been out on duty half the night. But the moment he
entered the room, with his head still bandaged, the
constable took the wind out of his sails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahoy, shipmate!” he said, “how’s the weather?
By what I hear you’ve run through a bit of a squall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, then?” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know! Of course I know. When my watch was
over, somewhere about four bells, and I came below
dead-beat and turned in, d’you think I could get any
sleep? Not a wink, believe me. There was my old
woman wide-awake, and bursting with the news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Gollop,’ says she, ‘there’s rogues and rascals in the
world.’ That being no news at all, I just gave a grunt
and began to snore. ‘Listen to me,’ says she, ‘and
don’t pretend.’ What you can’t help, put up with. So
I listened, always ready to oblige, and out it came,
like a flood over a weir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I own I dozed one or twice afore she was well under
way, but I was fair shook up when she’d got her canvas
full spread. You take my meaning? I’ve fought
with a cutlass, and I’ve knocked down a swabber
with a marline-spike, but never in my born days have
I hit a man with an oar; there’s something uncommon
about that, and as a constable I took note of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Foreign ways, to be sure. Them fellows in the boat
must have been some of the crew of that Portugal ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the big-nosed man with the black beard,”
said Martin. “I’m sure he was an Englishman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe, but I ask you, what was he doing along with
those foreigners? And what’s his ploy with Slocum?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, and why come along this very street?” Susan
put in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you go!” said Dick. “I’ve seen many a big
nose, also red, <span class='it'>and</span> black beards, likewise many tabby
cats. You can’t tell one from t’other unless you’ve
studied ’em. I see a tabby in one place; you see one
in another; that don’t make ’em the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s cats got to do with it?” protested Susan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” said Dick. “All I say is, if I took up a
man just because he’d a big red nose and a black beard
the magistrates would call me a fool, and belike I’d
have to pay damages, and then where’d you be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why talk about cats?” said Susan. “And
tabbies! Now if you’d said black cats——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drat the cats!” cried the constable. “You’ll go on
about ’em till you’re tired, I suppose. Martin, what I
say is, keep your weather-eye open, and if so be as you
spy that black-haired fellow again, keep him in sight,
my lad, and inform an officer of the law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tapping was heard on the banisters at the head of
the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Mounseer, Lucy,” said Susan, “waiting to
take you to school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little girl sprang up; she liked her morning
walk with the old Frenchman. She ran up the stairs,
but returned in a few moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mounseer says will you please lend him a hammer
and chisel,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Willing, and anything else,” said Gollop. “But
ask him if I can do the hammering for him. I’ve been
reckoned a handy man in my time; you have to turn
your hand to any odd job at sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl gave the message and returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mounseer says it’s a trifle, and he won’t trouble
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well then; take him the things, and welcome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman laid the tools on a chair in his room,
then locked the door and started with Lucy for the
half-mile walk to her school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon afterwards Gollop and Martin went out together,
the former to take his morning draught with his
cronies, the latter to make another effort to find work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his pocket he carried some bread and cheese, so
that he need not come home for the mid-day meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through the hot summer day he wandered about,
seeking employment. In the evening he returned and
reported that he had again met with no success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” said Susan. “Things will take a
turn. Now, just run upstairs and ask Mounseer for
that hammer. I want it to knock some nails in Lucy’s
cupboard, so as she can hang up her things tidy. Tell
him he shall have it back if he hasn’t done with it, but
he’s been banging nearly all day, so I dare say he has.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On reaching the Frenchman’s door Martin saw that a
staple had been fitted to one of the side joists, evidently
to receive a padlock. From within the room came the
sound of knocking. He tapped on the door; the sound
ceased and Mounseer asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s me, sir,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you, my young friend. Wait but one little
moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bolts were drawn inside, the door was opened,
and there stood Mounseer in his shirt-sleeves, chisel in
hand. Martin gave his message.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But yes; assuredly: I ask pardon for keeping it so
long. But you see, one must be careful. My lock was
broken by that villain; therefore I must make other
defences.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin noticed that an iron socket for a bar was
fitted to the inside of the door, and the bar itself, a
stout baulk of wood, was leaning against the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pouf! It is hot,” the Frenchman went on, “though
I take off my coat and open the window. A little rest
will be agreeable. But I ask for the hammer again,
until I finish; I wish to finish this night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Promising to bring the hammer back in a few
minutes Martin went down to the basement. But it
was more than half an hour later, and dusk was already
falling, before he was able to return: Susan’s job had
taken longer than he had expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time there was no answer to his tap on Mounseer’s
door, nor any sound from within. He waited
awhile, then tapped again. A sleepy voice asked who
was there, and when Martin was at last admitted, the
old gentleman apologised for the delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the terrible heat,” he said, spreading out his
hands. “I fall asleep; I am old, and the labour
fatigues me. How I would like to be young, like
you! Labour is light for the young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can’t get any work, sir,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Courage, my young friend. It will come. Seat
yourself, and tell me where you go to-day; I am very
much interested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting on a chair facing the open window, Martin
began to relate his wanderings of the day, while the
Frenchman took the hammer and chisel and worked
away at the bar of wood by the light of a candle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Martin was speaking he fancied he saw
something move just outside the window. Though
somewhat startled, he had the presence of mind to go
on with his story, and a few moments afterwards
was astonished to see a hat appear above the edge of
the window-sill, at a corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It rose slowly; the dim light of the candle at the
farther end of the room showed him a man’s face—a
face seamed with a scar across the temple. So great
was his surprise at recognising one of the men who had
tried to steal his parcel that he jumped up with a
sudden cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly the face disappeared, and by the time
Martin and the Frenchman reached the window the
man was half-way down the gutter-pipe up which he
had climbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With amazing quickness Mounseer seized a three-legged
stool and hurled it down. It missed the man
by an inch or two, and fell with a crash upon the
ground. In another second the man dropped beside it
and bolted across the open space into the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter?” asked a voice from above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking up, Martin saw Mr. Seymour, the occupant
of the upper floor, leaning over his window-sill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A matter of no consequence,” said the Frenchman,
drawing Martin back into the room. “I must close the
shutters,” he went on, “though it will be very hot.
But I do not like the curious people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That face belonged to one of the men who tried to
rob me,” said Martin. “It is strange he should have
come to the house where I live, for I’ve nothing worth
stealing here. I’ll describe him to Gollop, and he’ll circulate
the description, and someone will arrest the fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for me, my friend,” said the Frenchman. “I,
a stranger, would not give trouble. And indeed my
best protection is not in the Law, but in a few stout
bolts and my lifelong friend yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed to his rapier, hanging on the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was clear to Martin that the Frenchman wished to
be alone, so he said Good-night and went downstairs.
On the way he was struck by a curious circumstance.
According to Susan Gollop, Mounseer had been hammering
all day; why then was there so little sign of it? All
that he had done would have been the work of only an
hour or two. But perhaps the old gentleman was not
expert with tools.</p>

<h3>AN ADVENTURE IN PUDDING LANE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning, when the time came for Lucy to start
for school, the Frenchman said that he felt a little
indisposed, and would not venture out in the heat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take her,” said Martin. “But I can’t promise
to bring her back, because I’m going in search of work
again, and I don’t know where I’ll be when school is
over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you worry, my lad,” said Susan. “Dick will
be home then, and he can fetch the child for once.
And I hope you’ll get a job to-day, for it makes a
difference not having your few shillings at the weekend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had left his sister at the door of the dame’s
school, Martin stood for a minute or two undecided as
to the way he would go in his hunt for work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was feeling rather disheartened. It was the first
time Susan Gollop had said a word to hint that he was
a burden to her, and in his pride he was determined
that she should never have another occasion for any
remark of the sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up to the present his applications for a job had been
made at the larger places of business—establishments
that would rank equal with Mr. Greatorex’s shop in
Cheapside. But it was no time to pick and choose; he
would take the meanest job that offered itself, no
matter what it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It occurred to him that he might have better
success if he crossed the river and made inquiries at
the Hop Market in Southwark. In the course of his
walk towards London Bridge he was crossing Pudding
Lane, a narrow street near Billingsgate, when he was
almost thrown down by the sudden impact of a strange
figure that darted out of a baker’s shop at the corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steady!” he cried, putting up his hands to protect
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The figure recoiled, then without a word of excuse or
explanation dashed down the lane. Martin laughed;
he had never seen a more comical object than this boy,
a little bigger than himself, who was covered with
flour, and whose head was almost concealed in a large
mass of dough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His amusement was increased when he saw a second
figure issue from the shop—the figure of a short, stout
man, he too cased in dough and flour from head to foot.
The baker set off at a toddling scamper after the boy,
their course marked on the cobblestones with a white
trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments the pursuer recognised that his
chase was hopeless. The boy, indeed, had turned the
corner and was out of sight by the time his master had
run half a dozen paces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young villain!” cried the man, stopping short
and shaking his fist in the direction of the vanished
fugitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned back towards the shop, picking at the
dough that clung to his hair and beard, spluttering and
muttering curses the while. As he was passing Martin
a mass of the loosened dough fell over his eyes, and for
a moment he tottered like a blind man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin sprang to his side, held him steady, and
helped him to rid himself of some of the dough, which
hung in long clammy strips about his face, like the
curls of a full-bottomed wig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ugh! Ugh!” gasped the baker. “The insolent
young ruffian! Thank you! Thank you! My hair is
short, or—— The young viper! ’Tis a mercy none of
the neighbours have seen my plight. Quick, boy; lead
me. I can scarcely see my own shop door!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin took him by the arm and led him the few
paces to his shop. On the sign hanging above the door
were the words: “Faryner, Baker to His Majesty the
King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the shop Martin stayed to give further
assistance to the angry baker, who intermingled abuse
of the runaway boy with explanations, half to himself,
and half to Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whelp!” he exclaimed. “He comes late, and
when I tax him, is saucy, scandalously saucy. ’Twould
try the patience of a saint, and I’m no saint. Must
silence his chattering tongue. Up with a pan of dough;
dab it on the rascal’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The impudence of the knave! What does he do but
snatch up another pan and empty it over me—me, a
master baker, baker to the King, contractor to the
Admiralty, purveyor to half the nobility and gentry.
Ay, and flings a bag of flour at me. What do you think
of that? What is the world coming to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin did not venture to say what he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he’ll never darken my doors again, that’s
certain. And that reminds me. There’s his basket—the
loaves ought to have been delivered an hour ago. I
was already one boy short, and the rascal knew it, and
yet he came late. I shall lose some of my best customers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The greater part of the sticky mass had now been
plucked from the baker’s head. He looked ruefully at
the basket of loaves in a corner of the shop, scratched
his head, became conscious that there were still some
fragments of dough adhering to his short-clipped hair,
and burst out again into violent denunciation of his
errand boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the impulse of the moment Martin spoke up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take the basket. I’m out of a job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” exclaimed the baker, looking at him keenly
as if he was only just aware of him. “Who are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name’s Martin Leake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you honest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you try me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not a bad answer. You’ve done me a
service and I like the look of you. I’ll try you. Here’s
a list of the customers these loaves are to be delivered
to. Set off at once. Nay, wait! I don’t like changes.
If I try you, and you satisfy me, I shall expect you to
stick to the job. Five shillings a week and a loaf a day.
That’s my wages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be glad to earn that to begin with,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then that’s a bargain. Don’t loiter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin took the basket on his arm, and as he went
out he heard the baker mutter:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How shall I get rid of the rest of this plaguey
dough? The young ruffian!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scanning the list of customers given him, Martin
was interested to find at the bottom the name of Mr.
Slocum, at the goldsmith’s shop in Cheapside. The
idea of meeting his old master was not at all pleasant,
but he reflected that if he went to the back entrance,
from a yard leading out of Bow Lane, he would
probably avoid such a meeting, and see only the
housekeeper or the cook, who had both been on
friendly terms with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad it’s the last on the list,” he thought. “But
I wish I hadn’t to go there at all. What strange fate is
always bringing me into contact with old Slocum?
I don’t like it. There’s something mysterious about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was with a strange feeling of misgiving that
he trudged on with his heavy load of bread.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE TENTH</h1></div>

<h3>A MYSTERIOUS VISITOR</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s first hour’s experience as baker’s boy was
by no means pleasant. Mr. Faryner’s customers had
been kept waiting for their morning rolls and loaves,
and at nearly every house where Martin called he was
received with dark looks and cutting words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took it all in good part, explained that he was a
new boy, and promised to be earlier on the morrow.
As the basket became lighter he grew more cheerful,
and by the time he reached Bow Lane he had almost
forgotten the forebodings with which he had started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning into the yard by which he would reach the
back entrance to Mr. Slocum’s house he suddenly
collided with a boy coming in the opposite direction.
He was turning round; the basket was jerked off his
arm, and the two loaves it contained rolled out on the
cobblestones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, clumsy, why don’t you look where you are
going?” said a well-remembered voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had already recognised his old opponent, the
apprentice through whom he had been dismissed. He
was himself recognised before he could say a word in
reply, and for a moment or two the boys stared at
each other. Then the apprentice laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dash my eyes!” he said. “Do I see Martin
Leake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without waiting for an answer he swooped on the
loaves, picked them up, rubbed the dust off on his
breeches, and rushed back into the open doorway of
the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sally, here’s Martin Leake turned baker’s boy,”
Martin heard him shout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few seconds he came out again followed by the
cook with the loaves in her hands. Martin had picked
up his basket, and was standing just outside the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well I never!” exclaimed the cook, who had
always been well disposed towards Martin. “So you
are working for Faryner, are you? I was wondering
what had come to the boy. Mr. Slocum is in a towering
rage because he’s been kept waiting for his breakfast.
I’ll just send up the bread, then I’ll come back,
Master Hopton; mind you that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She retreated into the house, and the boys were left
at the door. They stood looking at each other awkwardly.
Martin bore Hopton no malice; on the other
hand he could not feel friendly towards him, and had
not the cook asked him to remain he would have
walked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slocum’s a terror,” said the apprentice suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin did not reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sent me out to buy a loaf,” Hopton went on.
“You saved me a journey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This did not appear to call for an answer. There
was silence again for a few moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, I’m sorry I got you turned out,” said
Hopton, awkwardly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t be,” said Martin, surprised. “I
wouldn’t come back again for anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t blame you. I’m sick of Slocum and his
tempers. Does Faryner pay you well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now what’s that to do with you, Master Hopton?”
said the cook, returning. “Just you run back to the
shop, or you’ll get into trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Sally,” said the apprentice, grinning.
He gave Martin a friendly wink as he turned into the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you have made up your quarrels,” said the cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure that we have,” replied Martin, with a
smile. “But he’s very friendly. I wonder why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wishes he were you, I daresay, instead of being
bound to Mr. Slocum for seven years. To Mr. Slocum,
says I, though ’tis really to Mr. Greatorex. Ah! I
wish the old master had never left the City. What
things are coming to I don’t know. Mr. Slocum’s
cursing and cuffing those apprentices from morning
till night, and you’re lucky to be out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness alone knows! It’s my belief he has
something on his mind, but—— There he is, bawling
for me. Don’t let him see you. Coming, sir, coming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin hurried away, feeling more than ever glad
that he was no longer in Mr. Slocum’s service, and
wondering whether his old employer’s ill temper was
connected in any way with his mysterious doings on
the riverside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another round, in a different part of the city,
occupied part of the afternoon, and Martin had to
clean out the shop before he left for home. Again it
had been a very hot day, and he was more tired than he
had ever been before; so tired, indeed, that he was not
inclined to talk about his new job.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis a come-down, to be sure, for a master mariner’s
son,” said Dick Gollop; “but what you can’t
help, make the best of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now don’t you go for to dishearten the lad, with
your come-downs,” said Susan. “ ’Tis honest and
useful, and we shan’t have to buy so much bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weary though he was, Martin that night found it
impossible to sleep. His room was small and felt like
an oven, though he had opened the window and the
door, and thrown off all the bedclothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The senses of a sleepless person are extraordinarily
acute, and as the hours dragged on Martin became
annoyed at the regular snores of Susan Gollop in the
room beyond. Dick happened to be out on night duty
again. For a long time the only other sounds Martin
heard were the footsteps of Mr. Seymour as he went
along the passage above and up the stairs to his room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s very late home,” thought Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard the lodger shut his door; then all was
silent again until a new sound, outside his window,
caught his ear. It was a slight thud, such as would be
made by a small object falling on the ground, and he
might hardly have noticed it had not recent events
made him heedful and suspicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rising from his bed he tiptoed on bare feet to the
window and looked out, taking care to keep out of
sight himself. It was a starry night, and he saw a dark
patch against the sky—the form of a man standing on
the square of waste ground above the basement level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His thoughts flew to the man who had climbed the
gutter pipe to the old Frenchman’s room, and his
heart began to beat more quickly. Then he heard
whispering voices. The man was evidently talking to
someone on one of the upper floors. Only a few
words were spoken, then the man walked quickly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was relieved; it seemed that there was to be
no further attack on the Frenchman’s room. But he
was also puzzled. Who was the man? Why should
anyone come in the dead of night to the back of the
house and talk to one of the inmates? And to whom
had he spoken? It must be either Mounseer or Mr.
Seymour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still listening and watching, Martin suddenly heard
the stairs creak. More than ever puzzled, and a little
alarmed, he stole out into the passage. There were now
footsteps in the hall above. He crept up the basement
stairs on hands and knees, and noticed a dim flickering
light upon the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the top of the staircase he bent low and peeped
round. A smoky candle was guttering on the hall
floor. The front door was partly open, and Martin
saw the back of a man in nightcap and dressing-gown,
talking to someone outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Seymour!” said Martin to himself. “It’s too
tall for Mounseer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sloop is in the river,” said a husky voice.
“It’s too risky. You had better take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I must, I must!” replied Mr. Seymour, in a low
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened the door a little farther. Martin felt
strangely excited. A mysterious visitor to Mr. Seymour;
a sloop in the river; some risky enterprise;
something that Mr. Seymour was to take; all these
circumstances sharpened his curiosity and caused him
to strain eyes and ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men between them carried a heavy object
into the hall. Martin could not see what it was, nor
could he see the features of the visitor. Mr. Seymour
was between them and the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember you’ll have to account to me,” said the
stranger in the same low, husky tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you don’t trust me,” replied Mr. Seymour
impatiently, “take it away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trust you—oh, yes!” was the answer, with a
slight gurgle of laughter. “But I thought I might as
well remind you. That’s all. Good-night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his back and went out into the darkness,
Mr. Seymour gently closing the door behind him. And
then Martin saw that the object on the floor was a
square box, brass-bound at the corners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Seymour shot the bolt without noise, shouldered
the box, which appeared to be of considerable weight,
then looked at the candle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound it!” he muttered, frowning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin guessed that he was annoyed because,
laden with the box, he could not stoop to lift the candle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, taking every step cautiously, he carried the
box up the first staircase, across the landing, and then
up the staircase to his own room. In a minute he
returned, picked up the candle, and ascended once
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s heart was thumping as he crept down to
his room again, and it was almost morning before he at
last fell asleep.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH</h1></div>

<h3>MR. SLOCUM AGAIN</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Having to be early at his new job, Martin was hurried
in the morning. When he left after a quick breakfast,
Dick Gollop was still a-bed; he had only returned from
his night duty about five o’clock. So Martin had no
opportunity of telling the constable of the strange
incident he had witnessed in the night, and he refrained
from mentioning it to the others for fear of alarming
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was still greatly puzzled, and his mind was full
of the matter as he walked to Mr. Faryner’s shop in
Pudding Lane. There was no reason why Mr. Seymour
should not have a box delivered to him. But why had
the messenger come secretly by night? What was the
danger? And what was the meaning of the mysterious
reference to the sloop in the river?</p>

<p class='pindent'>These questions were driven from his thoughts for a
time by his work. Mr. Faryner praised him for
coming punctually, gave him a few odd jobs to do, and
then sent him out on the morning round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In due course he arrived at the goldsmith’s house,
and once more made his way to the back entrance.
Leaving his basket just inside the door, he took the
four loaves intended for Mr. Slocum’s household up
the stairs to the kitchen on the first floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing the hall landing, he noticed that the door of
a small room which was usually kept locked now stood
ajar. The fact did not arouse any particular curiosity,
and he went on to the kitchen and handed the bread to
the friendly cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you are early,” she said, “though it
wouldn’t have mattered so much this morning. The
master isn’t up yet. He was out late last night, and I
warrant will be in a rare tantrum when he wakes. And
how do you like your new work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better when I’ve finished than when I begin,”
replied Martin, smiling. “The basket is very heavy at
the start, and it makes me very tired this hot weather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind; it’s something to be working for the
King’s baker, and I hope you’ll get on. There now!
What did I say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Slocum had just called “Sally!” from below
stairs, and his voice certainly sounded far from good-tempered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coming, sir,” the cook answered, and hurried to the
head of the staircase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to go at once to the dairyman’s in
Milk Street and complain of the mouldy cheese he sent
me. Tell him it’s not fit for pigs, and if he can’t serve
me better I’ll deal elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good, sir,” said Sally. “I’ll just fetch my
shawl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, woman; you don’t need your shawl a
hot day like this. Get away at once, and be sure you
don’t mince matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin heard Mr. Slocum’s loud angry tones distinctly.
The cook hurried downstairs, her master
talking at her all the time. As soon as she had left
the house Mr. Slocum dashed up the stairs, and Martin
realised that his retreat was cut off. He had no fear of
his old employer, but was not at all eager to meet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time Mr. Slocum reached the kitchen door,
Martin had stepped back into the shelter afforded by
the jutting corner of a large cupboard. Mr. Slocum
came in hurriedly, turned the key in the door, and
went straight across the room to another door that
led into a passage and thence into his private room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin waited, undecided whether to go at once or to
remain until he was sure the coast was clear. Just as he
was on the point of moving he heard Mr. Slocum returning,
and thought it better to stay where he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The goldsmith’s movements were much slower now,
and when he came into view Martin had a shock of
surprise. The man was carrying a box, brass-bound at
the corners, exactly like the box which had been
delivered to Mr. Seymour the previous night. He
passed across the kitchen, unlocked the door, and
began to descend the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin felt trapped. He was lucky in having
escaped notice so far; he could hardly hope not to be
observed if Mr. Slocum returned. And hearing Mr.
Slocum enter the room on the half-landing he hurried
after him on tip-toe, hoping to slip by unseen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as he reached the half-landing Mr. Slocum,
empty-handed, came out of the little room, shutting
the door behind him. Martin bent, and tried to dash
by; but Mr. Slocum heard him, turned quickly,
shot out his hand and caught him by the tail of his
coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who on earth are you?” cried the goldsmith.
“No use wriggling; I have you fast.” And then, as he
caught sight of Martin’s face: “You! You scoundrel!
Where have you come from? What business have you
here? Didn’t I tell you never to show your face
again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am working for Mr. Faryner, and have just
brought your bread,” Martin replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what are you hanging about for? Why are
you hiding in my house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cook was called away before she had time to
pay me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you are skulking here, stealing for all I know.
I’ll send for a constable, and give you in charge on
suspicion of loitering with the intention of committing
a felony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may do that if you please, Mr. Slocum,” said
Martin with spirit. “But you have nothing against
me, and you will look rather silly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this Mr. Slocum lifted his left hand to clout
Martin, who took advantage of a slight relaxing of the
grip of the other hand to wrench himself away and
leap down the stairs. He picked up his basket and
fled out into the yard, leaving Mr. Slocum shouting
threats and curses behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sequel to this unlucky meeting was seen later in
the day. On returning from his afternoon round
Martin found that Mr. Slocum had sent a message to
the baker, saying that if the new errand boy was sent
again to the house he would transfer his custom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were impudent, I suppose,” said Mr. Faryner,
“and you won’t suit me, and that’s a pity, for I’d
taken a fancy to you. It’s a lesson to me to make
inquiries before I hire a boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin thought it was high time to give his employer
a little information. He related the morning’s incident,
not mentioning the box; some instinct prompted
him to keep that to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was nothing much to be angry about,”
said the baker. “Have you told me everything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t told you that I was once in Mr. Slocum’s
employment, and he dismissed me for——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Impudence? Confess now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir; for fighting one of the apprentices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me, I’ve done that myself,” said Mr. Faryner,
with a laugh. “But come now, I can’t afford to lose a
good customer. I daren’t send you on that round
again. Let me see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stuck his hands into his belt and looked questioningly
at Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you row a boat?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve done it often,” said Martin. “My father was
a sea-captain, and I’ve helped my friends among the
watermen more than once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Capital! Then I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll put
another boy on your round, and I’ll give you the
river. You’ll take supplies to the ships in the Pool.
What do you say to that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say thank you, sir; I shall like it very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then. You see, I’ve taken a fancy to
you.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h3>THE BRASS-BOUND BOX</h3>

<p class='pindent'>When Martin reached home that evening he told his
friends of the approaching change in his work that was
due to Mr. Slocum. Susan Gollop’s red cheeks grew
redder as she listened to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Slocum is a monster!” she cried indignantly.
“I’d like to give him a piece of my mind, that I would!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now don’t you go putting your oar in, my woman,”
said the constable. “I don’t like the man, but he was
within his rights in turning out of the house the boy he
dismissed for misbehaviour——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Misbehaviour, indeed!” Susan interrupted.
“What’s his own behaviour like? Tell me that. Mr.
Greatorex ought to know what a temper the man
has got, and if he didn’t live so far away I’d tell him
myself. Martin shall write it down for me, being no
scholar myself, and we’ll send Mr. Greatorex a letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Avast there!” said Dick. “Look at it sensible,
Sue. Mr. Greatorex is the owner of the ship, so to put
it, and he’s made Slocum captain. ’Tain’t for us to
question his right so to do. And d’you think he’s going
to bother his head about the ship’s boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ship’s boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Martin, of course. In a manner of speaking
he was the ship’s boy aboard that craft.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stuff and nonsense!” exclaimed Susan. “You and
your ship’s boy—and Martin the son of a captain <span class='it'>and</span>
owner! Gollop, I wonder at your ignorance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear, what you can’t help, make the best of.
Let things alone, that’s what I say, and maybe Martin’ll
never meet Slocum again, and so it won’t matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was not long in deciding that Mr. Slocum had
really done him a good turn. He liked his new job—to
deliver bread to the ships in the Pool. Their officers,
coming into harbour after long voyages, were glad to
get a change from the hard, mouldy, and often worm-bitten
biscuit which they had to put up with at sea.
Mr. Faryner’s excellent loaves found a ready sale
among them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At least once, sometimes twice, a day Martin rowed
out from the steps below London Bridge to the vessels
that lay against the wharves or at anchor in the
river. Sometimes he would send up his bread in a
basket lowered over the side; sometimes, after tying
his painter to the anchor chains, he would himself
swarm up a rope ladder to the deck. Now and then
he had to scramble across the lighters surrounding
a vessel that was taking in or discharging cargo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found all this thoroughly interesting and enjoyable.
It was much easier to carry his basket in a boat
than to carry it on his arm. He liked to meet and chat
with the jolly sailor-men and to see the insides of the
ships whose outsides he knew so well. If he could not
go to sea himself, he felt that the next best thing was to
have something to do with those who did, even if it
were only supplying them with bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he was well satisfied with his change of masters.
Mr. Faryner, he found, was just as quick-tempered as
Mr. Slocum, but he was not mean or spiteful or unjust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One Saturday when Martin had made a slight
mistake in accounting for the money he had received
from customers, the baker flew into a rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re either a ninny or a rascal!” he cried. “And
I don’t know which is worse. Can’t you add two and
two? You’re no good to me. Boys are the plague of
my life, none of them any good. If they’re not saucy
they’re stupid, and if they’re not stupid they’re——.
Here, get out of my sight, and don’t stare at me as if I
were a fat pig at a fair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was careful to keep out of the angry man’s
way, and wondered whether, when he received his
week’s wages, he would be told to find another job. To
his surprise Mr. Faryner seemed to have forgotten the
matter that had upset him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here you are, my lad,” he said, as he handed
Martin his five shillings. “And you had better take
two loaves home to-night instead of one; there are
some over, and they’ll be too stale to sell by Monday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like many another quick-tempered man’s, Mr.
Faryner’s bark was worse than his bite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Martin got home that evening he found Susan
Gollop in a great state of excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what’s coming to us all,” she said.
“Only think of it! When Mounseer came back from his
walk this afternoon he found his room all upside-down
and higgledy-piggledy, and me in the house all the
time, and never heard a sound!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened?” asked Martin, remembering the
former attempts on the Frenchman’s room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, someone got in, front or back, I don’t know
how, and picked his padlock, and rummaged the room,
forced open his cupboard, slit up his mattress, and even
ripped the lining of his coat on the peg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why? What were they seeking?” Martin
asked in his amazement. “He seems to have nothing
valuable except his sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! That’s what puzzles me. And what’s more,
Mounseer didn’t seem very upset when he came in and
found everything topsy-turvy. He just looked round
the room, and then he smiled—fancy that; smiled!—as
if it was just a muddle made by children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You take it easy, sir,’ says I, and he gave his
shoulders a shrug—you know his way—and said, ‘Be
so good, madam’—he called me madam—‘to help
me arrange.’ And when we were in the middle of
putting things straight, who should come in but Mr.
Seymour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Dear me!’ says he, all astonished like, ‘what in
the world is the matter?’ And just as I was opening
my mouth, Mounseer took me up short. ‘Nothing in the
world, sir,’ says he, ‘I thank you!’ And he goes
straight to the door and shuts it in Mr. Seymour’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was fair took aback; where were his French
manners? Always so polite to me, calling me madam
and all, and yet almost rude to Mr. Seymour!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mounseer must have took a dislike to him, that’s all
I can say, and very queer it is, for Mr. Seymour is a
nice, pleasant-spoken gentleman, with always a ‘Good-day,
Mrs. Gollop!’ or ‘Very warm, Mrs. Gollop!’
whenever I meet him on the stairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin said nothing to this, though recent incidents
had made him uncomfortable, and inclined to share in
Mounseer’s evident distrust of the mysterious lodger on
the top floor. His doubts were deepened by something
that happened that very night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was disturbed from a sound sleep by slight noises
from the waste land at the rear of the house. They
were louder than they had been on the previous
occasion, and he guessed that the man below had had
more difficulty in attracting Mr. Seymour’s attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But things happened as before. There was a short,
murmured exchange of words between the two men;
the speaker below went away, Mr. Seymour came with
scarcely a sound down the stairs. Martin reached his
post near the top of the basement staircase in time to
hear the same husky voice outside the front door say:
“The sloop is back in the river.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Mr. Seymour opened the door wide, and the
other man brought in a brass-bound box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s heavier this time,” said Mr. Seymour. “You
must give me a hand with it upstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not safe. You’ve got slippers; my sea-boots
make too much noise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take them off, and walk in your stockings!” said
Mr. Seymour, impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other man growled, but came forward, set the
box on the floor, and sat on it while he removed his
boots. His features were still concealed from Martin by
Mr. Seymour’s figure between him and the candle half-way
down the hall. He stood up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heave ho,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Martin started, and instinctively shrank
back a little. When he looked out again the two men,
carrying the box between them, were full in the light
of the guttering candle, and in the larger of them he
recognised the black-bearded stranger whom he had
first seen at the river stairs in the company of Mr.
Slocum, and whom he had rowed down to Deptford in
Jack Boulter’s wherry.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH</h1></div>

<h3>BLACKBEARD VISITS THE BAKER</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The astonishing discovery that Mr. Seymour and Blackbeard,
as he called the stranger to himself, had dealings
in common kept Martin awake for a good many hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He acknowledged that there was no reason why they
should not have business relations, but there seemed to
be something underhand in these stealthy visits by
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he got up in the morning he went straight into
Dick Gollop’s room, and roused him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” asked the constable, sleepily.
“It’s not my watch yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wake up and listen!” replied Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Been fighting again, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Do wake up; it’s something you ought to
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, spin your yarn, and don’t be long about it, or
my eyes’ll shut, and then my ears won’t be no manner
of good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin wasted no words in recounting the story of
Blackbeard’s two midnight visits and the conveying up
to Mr. Seymour’s room of the two brass-bound boxes.
Gollop began to snore in the middle of it, but was
roused again by a vigorous shake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you spoil a man’s sleep for that!” the constable
grumbled. “I wouldn’t have thought it of
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, look here, my lad!” said Gollop, raising
himself on one elbow, “don’t you go for to teach me
anything about the law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t going——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stow your gab and hark to me! Ain’t I a constable,
and therefore a man of law? Well, then, I tell you
there’s nothing in the law to prevent a man, two men,
forty men, bringing a box, two boxes, forty boxes, into
a house at any watch o’ the night, dog-watch included.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t interrupt. If so be I was to run athwart the
course of a man conveying a box in the middle watches
it ’ud be my bounden duty to hail him and ask where
he was bound for—if ’twas in the street, mind you, and
I was on my rounds. But when a man has got across
his own threshold—set his foot on his own deck in a
manner of speaking—then I question him at my peril.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t you search the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not being an inward-bound ship, nor me a customs
officer, I couldn’t, not without a warrant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not get a warrant?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? Because there’s no reason to think
there’s anything contraband in them boxes; and,
what’s more, because I’m dead sleepy. So just you set
a course for your baker’s shop, my lad; what you can’t
help, make the best of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was by no means satisfied that the constable’s
exposition of the law was sound, but it was
clearly impossible to do anything more with him until
he had finished his sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That morning, Martin, in the course of his duty,
boarded a vessel moored near Wapping which he had
already visited several times, and where he had
established friendly relations with the cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two quarterns to-day, and mind they’re not stale,”
said the cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We never have any stale; our bread sells like hot
cakes,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s a new customer for you astern there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cook pointed to a vessel at anchor a few cables’
lengths down the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, isn’t that the Portugal ship that was repairing
at Deptford?” Martin asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, that’s her. She came up out of the yard on the
tide yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw her in the yard not long ago. She’s had her
mainmast shot away by the French, they said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, that was the yarn. She’s a queer sort of
vessel, by all accounts. The crew are all black-haired
men, but that you’d expect, being Portugals or
Levantines, or summat outlandish. What’s queer is
that they’re never allowed leave on shore. Even in
Deptford, when the ship was being overhauled, they
had to sling their hammocks in an old warehouse on the
riverside. They was marched about like a lot of
prisoners—conveyed there and back by the officers—and
a dark-looking lot they are too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The captain’s a white man—white, says I, meaning
he’s not a nigger, for his face is the colour of beer, and
his hair as black as coal, and his beard like a horse’s
mane. And it’s well his crew are foreigners, for true-born
Englishmen wouldn’t stand that sort of treatment;
there’d be mutiny aboard, trust me. But there’s
no proper spirit in those Portugals; I don’t call ’em
men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re men enough to eat English bread, I
expect,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See that you get English money. I wouldn’t trust
’em far,” declared the cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin laughed as he went down the side. He had
already got one or two new customers for his master,
and he was so much interested in this Portugal vessel
that he felt rather excited at the prospect of boarding
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he rowed towards her he began to have
qualms. It was members of her crew that had chased
him that night when he had rowed Boulter’s wherry
down to Deptford and picked up the fugitive boy. He
remembered their wild looks and savage cries; above
all, he remembered the face of the man who had urged
them on—the man who had been his passenger—Blackbeard
himself. What if he were recognised when
he ran alongside the vessel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>This idea daunted him, and swinging the boat round,
he headed up the river. But before he was half-way
back to London Bridge he wished he had taken the
risk. After all, what had he to fear? Blackbeard might
not be aboard the ship; the crew had seen him only
indistinctly in the dusk, and they had been more intent
on the boy he had taken into the boat than on himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further, suppose Blackbeard did recognise him,
what then? He would know him only as the rower of
the wherry, who had allowed a boy swimming in the
river to climb into his boat for safety. There was
nothing in that; anyone else might have done the same.
Blackbeard could not know that he lived in the same
house as Mr. Seymour, and was aware of his mysterious
visits to that gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though he repented his timidity, he felt that he
had come too far to return now. As it turned out, he
was glad of his decision, for in the evening, just before
closing time at the shop, when he was sweeping up the
flour and breadcrumbs that littered the floor, and had
his back to the door, he was startled to hear behind him
the husky voice of the man he had been thinking about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon, sir,” said the voice; and Martin noticed
that it had a foreign accent, not at all like that in which
Blackbeard had spoken to Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced over his shoulder, thinking he might be
mistaken; but no, he could not mistake that swarthy
face and strangely-trimmed beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon, sir, are you the baker as send bread to the
ships on the river?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, to be sure,” said Mr. Faryner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I beg you send three breads regular all the
days to the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span> what lie by Wapping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you the captain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, I will send the bread, and you will
pay on the spot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without doubt, yes, I will pay. Good-night.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH</h1></div>

<h3>ON BOARD THE <span class='it'>SANTA MARIA</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Before Martin started on his river journey next morning,
Mr. Faryner impressed upon him that he must not
leave bread upon the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span> without payment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been done before now,” said the baker. “I’ve
given credit to foreign captains and they’ve sailed
away without settling. Once bit, twice shy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin visited his regular customers as usual, then
rowed on to the Portugal vessel, which lay some distance
from the other ships, and was the last for that
morning’s delivery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His fears of the previous evening had left him, but he
was conscious of a rather quickening pulse as he brought
his boat under the side. Dark-browed men, leaning on
the bulwarks, peered curiously at him, and he could not
help wondering whether one or another of them might
recognise his features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rope ladder hung from the waist. Catching hold
of this, he looked up and called:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bread for the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his surprise none of the men answered. They
continued to stare at him but did not change their
positions. Even if they did not understand English, he
thought they might guess his errand from the sight of
the loaves in his basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bread,” he called again, “ordered by the captain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then someone repeated the word <span class='it'>capitano</span>, and
Martin inferred from the way they talked among themselves
that the captain was not on board. Emboldened
by this discovery, Martin pointed to the loaves, and
made signs that they were intended for the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, Sebastian,” cried one of the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments later a very fat man came from
behind and pushed his way through to the side. His
swarthy cheeks hung like dewlaps over his thick neck,
his shirt was open, revealing a massive chest almost
as dark as his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What want?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The captain ordered these loaves from the King’s
baker,” Martin replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up, up,” said the man, whose English appeared to
be limited to monosyllables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin began to do as he had been instructed:
to place the loaves in a small sack, sling this on his
back, and swarm up the ladder. But when Sebastian,
whom he supposed to be the cook, saw his intention,
he cried “No, no,” waved him back, and let down
a rope, indicating that Martin was to tie the sack to
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There seemed to be nothing else to be done, though
Martin was disappointed: he had hoped for an opportunity
of seeing something of this mysterious vessel.
The sack was drawn up; the man took it in his huge
dirty hands, and was turning away when Martin
detained him by calling out the word “money,” at
the same time jingling the bag that contained his
morning’s takings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No money; captain not here,” said the man.
“Come again other time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t do that,” said Martin. “My master’s orders
were not to go without the money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Basta!” exclaimed the cook; then he turned on his
heel and disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without an instant’s hesitation, Martin hitched his
painter to the rope ladder, and, swarming up, sprang on
to the deck. The seamen made way for him, and
looked on impassively as he darted across the deck.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/img-071.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0004' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The cook was on the point of entering the galley,
carrying the sack slung loosely across his shoulders. He
turned as he heard quick footsteps, but was too late to
prevent Martin from snatching the sack away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man snarled an ejaculation in his own tongue,
and lurched heavily forward with arms outstretched as
if to recapture the sack. But Martin skipped back, held
the sack behind him, and said firmly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must have two shillings, or I cannot leave the
bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the cook could reply, one of the crew made a
remark which drew a roar of laughter from his mates,
and brought a fierce scowl upon Sebastian’s face, and a
torrent of angry words from his lips. Martin noticed
how his multiple chin shook as he denounced the men
who were chaffing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came on, threateningly, and Martin edged back,
intending to toss the sack into the boat and at least
save his bread. But at this moment there appeared
round the side of the galley a slight, thin, dusky-faced
boy, in whom Martin at once recognised the child he
had vainly tried to save from his pursuers a few nights
before. The boy’s manner suggested that curiosity had
drawn him to see what was going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His appearance served to divert the cook’s wrath.
Turning aside, Sebastian dealt the boy a heavy blow
that struck him sprawling upon the deck, and lifted
his foot to kick him as he lay. With a sudden spring
Martin thrust himself between the bully and his
victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment there was dead silence; then a jesting
remark from the seaman who had spoken before
evoked loud guffaws from the rest of the crew. Purple
with rage, Sebastian aimed a kick at Martin, who
evaded it by a quick sidelong movement, at the same
time swinging his sack and banging the man on the
side of the head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sudden blow upset his balance. He toppled
sideways, and with a resounding thump measured his
huge bulk on the deck. The boy, meanwhile, had
picked himself up and darted into the galley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment a man, somewhat better dressed
than the others, came up through the open hatchway
and uttered a few words in a commanding tone of
voice. Martin guessed that he was demanding the
meaning of the uproar. A babel of explanations broke
from the crew. The newcomer silenced them with a
stern gesture, his uneasy manner suggesting he was
anxious to put a stop to the scene and avoid further
trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a contemptuous look at Sebastian, who had
now risen to his feet, he ordered him away, and opening
a wallet that was slung at his belt, made signs that
Martin was to take from it the money due to him.
Martin picked out two shillings, emptied the sack on
the deck, then clambered down the side into his boat
and rowed away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Remembering the vindictive scowl on the cook’s face
as he slunk off, he wondered whether his impetuous
action might not have done the boy more harm than
good. He felt a great pity for the wretched-looking
little fellow, with his thin cheeks and wistful, melancholy
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t much good to him before,” he thought,
“and only got myself a sore head. I suppose he is
cook’s mate to that fat bully, and leads a dog’s life on
board this strange ship. No doubt they’ll tell Blackbeard
all about it when he comes on board, and I
shouldn’t wonder if he complains to Mr. Faryner, and
I shall get into hot water again. Well, I couldn’t do
anything else, and as Dick Gollop says, what you can’t
help, make the best of.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH</h1></div>

<h3>COFFEE FOR TWO</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Martin debated with himself whether to tell Mr.
Faryner what had happened on board the <span class='it'>Santa
Maria</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I mention the squabble he may think I’m a
quarrelsome fellow,” he said to himself ruefully.
“He’ll say I get into trouble everywhere, on land and
on water too, and tell me to go. And I did want to go
aboard again: there’s something queer about that ship,
and I’d like to know more about her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened when he got back to the shop that the
baker was so much concerned with another matter that
he gave Martin no opportunity of telling his story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got another job for you, my lad,” he said.
“You know Mr. Pasqua’s coffee-house in Newman’s
Court?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir; and I don’t know where Newman’s Court
is,” Martin replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s off Cornhill; you know that. Well, Mr.
Pasqua came himself this morning and ordered a
quantity of rolls and cakes to be sent to his coffee-house.
It’s a feather in my cap, my lad. He used to
deal with Grimes of Gracious Street, but he’s dissatisfied.
I never did think much of Grimes. Mr.
Pasqua will be a very good customer if I please him,
and I promised that the things should be sent by one
o’clock, and you’re back just in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must I go before dinner, sir?” asked Martin, who
had been out in the heat since early morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before dinner? Of course you must. What does
your dinner matter when there’s a new customer to be
served? The basket will be ready in five minutes; you
can have your dinner presently. And let me tell you,
you must be very polite to Mr. Pasqua if you see him.
He has been a servant, and there’s no one more likely
to take offence at want of politeness in a servant than a
man who has been a servant himself. And he’s a
foreigner too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Frenchman, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, a Sicilian. I wonder you haven’t heard of him.
He was the servant of an English merchant who lived
in the East, and came back with his master a few years
ago to make coffee for him in the Eastern way. Mr.
Edwards, the merchant, had learnt the use of coffee-beans,
and he was so plagued and pestered by his
friends and visitors wanting to taste the new drink that
he set his servant up in a coffee-house, and the man is
now a good deal richer than I am. Here’s the last
batch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man came from the bakery bearing a tray laden
with crisp brown rolls and rice-cakes. These were placed
in the basket and Martin set off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following the fashion set by Mr. Pasqua, others had
opened coffee-houses in different parts of the city; but
they were frequented only by merchants and gentlemen,
and Martin had never been inside one. It was
therefore with considerable interest that he entered the
coffee-house in Newman’s Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a large square room with a counter at one end,
on which stood glistening urns, porcelain cups, and
silver sugar-basins. Behind it was a young woman with
golden hair piled high upon her head. A kettle hung
from a hook over a wood-fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here and there about the room were small tables
surrounded by wooden chairs. At one side the room
was partitioned off into compartments, some with doors,
within which the merchants could sip their coffee and
talk over their business in privacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two boys were serving customers at the tables, and
a small, dark, foreign-looking man was moving about,
exchanging a word here and a word there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Martin entered with his laden basket, the
foreigner, Mr. Pasqua himself, came up to him, and
speaking in very good English, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are from Faryner’s, boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are in very good time. It is not yet one o’clock,
and I am pleased. Grimes’s boy was late, over and over
again, and I was in danger of losing my customers, the
gentlemen who honour me. Tell Mr. Faryner that he
has begun well. And now let me see what you have
brought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took a cake and a roll from the basket, and bit
each of them in turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good,” he said, as he munched, smacking his
lips and blinking his eyelids. Martin was amused at
the little man’s serious air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calling one of his boys, he bade him take the basket
to the signorina. This was evidently the young woman
behind the counter, but as she spoke in a very decided
London accent Martin felt sure she was not a foreigner
and wondered why she was so called. It was a harmless
affectation of Mr. Pasqua’s, like that which, in those days
of Charles II, gave Italian names to English musicians
and mountebanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the basket was being emptied, Mr. Pasqua
said to Martin:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look tired, boy. Would you like a cup of
coffee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never tasted it, sir,” Martin answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then this shall be a great day in your life. A cup
of coffee, signorina.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A small cup was brought to Martin. Sipping it, he
made a wry face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! You find it bitter,” said Mr. Pasqua. “But
stir it with the spoon, then taste again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the bottom of the cup was thick brown sugar.
Martin stirred and tasted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is good, eh?” said the man, smiling. “It
will refresh you. And you shall have another cup when
you come the next time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment a bell rang in one of the closed
compartments. Mr. Pasqua himself hurried to answer
the summons. As the door opened, Martin was startled,
and hastily turned his head. Seated at the little table
were two men, Mr. Slocum and Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was careful not to look towards them again, and
was glad when the empty basket was brought to him
and he was able to get out into the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His first feeling was relief that he had not been seen
by Mr. Slocum. He thoroughly distrusted his former
employer, and was ready to believe that he would not
hesitate to make mischief with Mr. Pasqua.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why am I always coming across that man?” he
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then as he walked back towards Pudding Lane, he
grew uneasy and suspicious. It was a shock to him
that Mr. Slocum and Mr. Seymour were acquainted.
He had seen each of them at different times with Blackbeard,
and the fact that all three were acquainted
brought a crowd of recollections to his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered that he had seen Mr. Slocum carrying
a brass-bound box exactly like those which Blackbeard
had brought to Mr. Seymour. He recalled how angry
Mr. Slocum had been on that occasion, without any
obvious reasonable cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackbeard’s visits to Mr. Seymour had been secret.
Was Mr. Slocum’s anger due to the fact that he
also had something to conceal? What was the connection
between the three men? Had it anything to do
with the boxes? What did they contain? Were they
part of the cargo of the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>?—perhaps held
smuggled goods?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Puzzling about these questions, Martin suddenly
thought of another—one that startled him. What was
the nature of the business between Mr. Slocum and the
old Frenchman?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question came as a surprise to Martin himself.
At first he did not understand what had given rise to
it, but he found himself fitting together incidents that
had previously seemed unrelated, and the more he
thought of them the more disturbed he grew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto no one had been able to account for the
strange attacks on the Frenchman’s room. But Martin
now remembered that the face he had seen one night at
the window was the face of the man who had waylaid
him going an errand for Mr. Slocum. He remembered
also Mounseer’s dislike of Mr. Seymour—and Mr.
Seymour knew Mr. Slocum. It was odd that, somehow
or other, Mr. Slocum came into everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was the mystery behind it all? To all appearance
the Frenchman possessed nothing that was
worth stealing; yet what other motive than robbery
could anyone have had for breaking into his room?
Mounseer knew Mr. Slocum. Mr. Slocum knew Mr.
Seymour, and that gentleman, in spite of his politeness
and his neighbourly intentions, was evidently suspected
and detested by the Frenchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin began to feel very much worried, and had the
extraordinary conviction that the clue to the whole
mystery lay with Mr. Slocum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare say it’s very silly,” he thought; “it’s simply
because I dislike the man. Yet I can’t help it. The
question is, what is Mr. Slocum at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This question was dinning in Martin’s head as he
walked back along the street. So intent was he on his
own thoughts that he stepped rather heedlessly, and
was brought up by the sudden collision with a man
proceeding in the opposite direction. The man let out a
savage oath, and Martin, uttering an apology, edged
away, only then recognising that the angry footfarer
was Blackbeard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately, he thought, he had not himself been
recognised, and, allowing a short interval to elapse, he
had the curiosity to follow the man. It was with no
surprise that he saw him enter Mr. Pasqua’s coffee-house.
Beyond doubt he was going to meet the two
men whom Martin had already seen there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More curious than ever, Martin wished that he could
find some means of discovering what the three conspirators,
as he now considered them, were about to
discuss. He thought of going in and buying a cup of
coffee on the chance that he might learn something, but
after a moment’s reflection gave up the idea; there
would be too much danger of his being caught.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH</h1></div>

<h3>WHAT MARTIN FOUND</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The tide was running strong up the river when Martin
started on his round next morning. There was promise
that the day would be hotter than ever, but the wind,
blowing briskly from the east, tempered the heat,
though at the same time it rendered doubly hard the
task of rowing the heavy wherry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was just pulling away from a brig at which he
had delivered some loaves, when a boat, sculled by a
single seaman, passed him in the opposite direction.
He recognised it at once as the boat belonging to the
<span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>, and the oarsman as the man who found
it so difficult to keep awake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Previously he had seen him only in the evening, and
he could not help feeling curious as to what his errand
was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After visiting in turn the ships on his list, and
scratching off the name of one that had left her moorings,
he came at length to the last, the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She won’t be here long,” he thought, noticing that
a lighter lay on each side of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the one on the starboard side cargo was being
hoisted on board by means of a clumsy kind of derrick.
He made his boat fast to the other, put the loaves into
his sack, threw the empty basket into the stern, and,
with the sack slung over his shoulder, swarmed up by a
rope that hung from a second derrick, placed ready for
use when the second lighter should be discharged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All hands were busy with the cargo. Some of the
crew grinned when they recognised him, and as he
looked inquiringly round they pointed to the cook’s
galley. Wondering what his reception would be, he
went on, and found the fat man frying some fish on his
brazier, the timid-looking boy standing by with a
flask of oil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cook glanced at Martin with a surly scowl, and
paid him no further attention until he had turned out
the fried fish on to a plate standing on a tray. Then he
took one of the fresh, crisp rolls that Martin had
brought, set this also on the tray, and ordered the boy
to carry breakfast to the captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy had only just gone, and Sebastian was
counting the contents of Martin’s sack, when the
captain, Blackbeard himself, came along, as if attracted
by the smell of the frizzling fish. Catching
sight of Martin he stopped, looked hard at him for a
moment or two, then, in his husky voice with its
foreign intonation, asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you do here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have brought the bread from Mr. Faryner,”
Martin replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” There was a slight pause. “I see you
before?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was clear that he had not at once recognised
Martin as the boy who in the evening dusk had rowed
him down the river. Anxious to avoid identification,
Martin answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was in Mr. Faryner’s shop when you came to give
your order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! So! I see you there—yes—perhaps. I think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was a puzzled look on his face as he
followed the boy with the tray, and Martin was on
thorns lest clearer recollection should come to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having counted the loaves and rolls, the cook, who
had not addressed a word to Martin, went away to
fetch the money for them. Martin would not have been
surprised if he had been summoned to the captain’s
cabin; but Sebastian on his return simply handed him
the coins, and he was free to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without loss of time he swarmed down on to the
lighter, threw his sack upon the upturned basket in the
stern of the boat rocking alongside, hauled on the painter
until the boat was near enough for him to step in, then
cast loose, drifting on the tide while he got out his
oars. Then he pulled the boat round, but rested on the
oars as he looked back at the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I ought to have asked when she is sailing,”
he thought. “But I suppose Blackbeard will give
notice. I wonder what her cargo is and where she is
bound for? Perhaps Mr. Seymour and Mr. Slocum are
engaged in some venture overseas, and there is nothing
really to be suspicious about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was still in a sort of daydream, moving the oars
only enough to keep the boat’s head straight, when a
shout ahead roused him. Glancing over his shoulder,
he saw a ferryboat crossing his bows. A collision
seemed inevitable, but he eased his left oar and put all
his strength into his right, and scraped by with an
inch or two to spare, the ferryman pouring out a
torrent of abuse such as only the Thames waterman of
those days could command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat rocked under the sudden change of course
and the wash of the ferryboat. Martin pulled her round
again, and noticed that the basket had shifted slightly.
It was now partly resting on its side against the stern
thwart. And then he caught sight of something dark
between the rim of the basket and the floor of the boat—something
that surprised him so much that for a
few moments he ceased rowing and could only stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a small dark-skinned foot, the toes and instep
just protruding from the basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s there?” he called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foot was suddenly withdrawn, the basket moved,
settling down so as to cover completely the person
underneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve seen you; you’d better show yourself,” said
Martin. An idea struck him, and he added: “Just
show your face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basket moved again, and now Martin saw
without surprise the dark, pathetic face of the cook’s
boy of the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t come out. I’ll row on,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked back towards the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>, now some
two hundred yards astern. The crew were still hoisting
and stowing the cargo; there was no sign of excitement,
nothing to show that the boy had been missed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin rowed on in silence for a few minutes until
the bend in the river hid the vessel from sight. Then he
said again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t come out. Keep the basket over you. But
tell me why you are on my boat, and what it is that
you want.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH</h1></div>

<h3>STOP, THIEF!</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It was a strange scene—had anyone witnessed it. But
Martin was careful to keep out of the course of passing
wherries, and so far from the ships at anchor that the
bottom of his boat was not visible from their decks.
The rim of the basket rested on the boy’s neck, and
his dusky face, with its large pleading eyes upturned
towards Martin, looked as though it projected from
the planking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me run away,” said the boy in a strange, high-pitched
sing-song. “No takee me back. No let
catchee me. I pray sahib very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you come from?” said Martin. “What
are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me India boy, come long way over black water.
They beat me. See!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved the basket a little, disclosing his thin,
bare arms and legs, on which were old scars and the
long livid weals of recent lashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cover yourself,” said Martin hastily. “Go on.
Tell me more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy went on to relate, in his halting broken
English, a story that Martin heard with indignation
and pity. His name was Gundra, and his parents were
servants of an English merchant at Surat. He had
been allowed to run in and out of the merchant’s
godowns, and had thus picked up the little English he
knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, when he was straying some little distance
from the factory, he was kidnapped by two big men,
who carried him aboard their ship. There he had been
kept as a slave, half-starved, and cruelly used. He had
not one real friend among the crew, though the
captain now and then interposed when the fat cook
was thrashing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So wretched was his life that he had long wished he
might die, and if he were taken back to the ship he
would throw himself overboard and let himself drown,
though he could swim, as the sahib had seen. More
than once he had been tempted to destroy himself, but
had been restrained by the hope that some day he
might be rescued and restored to his home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep me to be your slave, sahib,” he pleaded.
“Me do all you tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy’s woebegone look, and the sight of the
wounds on his limbs, moved Martin so deeply that he
had already determined to do what he could to save
him from his oppressors. But he foresaw great difficulties.
What could he do with the boy? There was
no room in Dick Gollop’s apartments; besides, he felt
sure the constable, as a man of law, would hold strong
views about the offence of harbouring runaways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he could not land the boy and leave him to his
own devices. He would be taken up as a vagrant, and
what would become of him then? His lot could
hardly be worse than it had been on board the <span class='it'>Santa
Maria</span>; but Martin felt that by giving the boy shelter
he had shouldered a certain responsibility, and that
he must not throw the little fellow into the uncertain
hands of chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was thinking over the problem so suddenly
thrust upon him, he had been paddling gently, but the
swift-flowing tide had already borne the boat a good
distance up the river. It was clear that he must come
to a decision within a few minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no friends but the Gollops and some of the
watermen, and he could not place the boy with them
until he had consulted them. The idea of running up as
far as Battersea or Chelsea, and leaving Gundra there
until later, occurred to him; but he was due to
return to the shop, and he shrank from incurring Mr.
Faryner’s displeasure. If it had been evening, as on
the former occasion, he might have left the boy in the
boat until after dark, but there were still many hours
of daylight to run, and the boat would be a very
insecure shelter, even if the boy were hidden under
sacking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After much thought he decided that the simplest
course was the best. He would land at the stairs nearest
his home, take the boy there as quickly as possible,
hand him over to good-hearted Susan Gollop, and go
back to his work. What was ultimately to be done
with Gundra must be left for discussion with the
constable and his wife after the day’s work was done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were two or three boats at the foot of the
stairs as Martin approached, intending to land on the
up-river side. But as he pulled in towards them he
suddenly noticed that one of the boats on that side
was the ship’s boat of the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>, which he had
passed when rowing down. The foreign seaman was in
his usual attitude when waiting, half doubled up in the
stern, and apparently asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin at once altered his course, bearing hard on his
right oar so as to bring the boat to the nearer side of the
stairs. At the same time he gave Gundra an urgent
warning to keep himself well covered by the basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled easily in to the landing-place. The other
boats were unoccupied, the watermen, their owners,
being out of sight, though no doubt within hail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was beginning to tie his boat to the post
when footsteps on the stairs above caused him to look
up. It was with a feeling almost of dismay that he
saw Mr. Seymour coming down, carrying a large square
object wrapped in sacking—no doubt a box, perhaps
one of the brass-bound boxes that Blackboard had
brought to the house. Behind him came a man laden
with a similar burden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next oars, sir?” called a hoarse, loud voice, and a
waterman appeared at the head of the steps. “Next
oars” was the phrase commonly used by watermen
plying for hire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to-day,” replied Mr. Seymour over his shoulder.
“I have my own boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waterman growled about people who did honest
men out of a living, and walked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was desperately anxious that Mr. Seymour
should not observe him. He dared not go up the stairs
and meet him face to face; not that he had any dread
of a meeting for himself, but because of his knowledge
of the runaway boy and his new-born suspicions of
Mr. Seymour’s relations with Blackbeard and Mr.
Slocum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning his back to the stairs, he fumbled with his
painter, as if he found a difficulty in tying up the boat.
He had, in fact, tied, untied, and tied again before
Mr. Seymour and his companion had stowed their
burdens on board, and his back was still towards them
when he knew by the thudding of the oars in the
rowlocks that their boat had put off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was some little time before he allowed himself to
face about, hoping that the danger of recognition was
past. But he had not reckoned with the strength of
the current. The seaman, pulling the heavily-weighted
boat against the stream, had made only a few yards.
Mr. Seymour’s face was turned towards the shore. He
caught sight of Martin, waved his hand in recognition,
and smiled in his usual pleasant way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t guess what I’ve got under my basket,”
Martin thought, at the same time feeling unreasonably
annoyed at having been recognised at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that the coast was clear he paddled round to the
side of the stairs, and tied up his wherry at the place
vacated by the ship’s boat, wasting time until that
craft was well out of sight. Then, after a look all
round, he lifted the basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come with me,” he said to the Indian boy, taking
him by the hand, and slinging the basket over his
other arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hand in hand they ascended the stairs. Lolling
against a rail was the waterman who had offered his
wherry to Mr. Seymour—a man whom he knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahoy, young master! What have you got there?”
said the man, looking quizzingly at the dark-faced
boy, who, at the sound of his rough voice, shrank
timidly to Martin’s side and clasped his hand more
tightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An Indian boy come ashore to see London,”
Martin replied. “There’s no need to mention it if
questions are asked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mum’s the word, eh? Ay, ay, I’ll keep my tongue
under hatches, never fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two boys had walked only a few yards when
they came upon the man who had accompanied Mr.
Seymour. He was seated on a tree-stump, smoking,
idly watching the river. As the boys passed him he
turned and looked at them, but Martin could not
gather from his expression whether he had paid them
any special attention or not. A few minutes afterwards,
however, when they were going up the gentle
hill that would presently bring them to Bishopsgate,
Martin chanced to turn his head, and saw, with a
feeling of alarm, that the man was following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a flash he realised that while he had been watching
Mr. Seymour the other man must have been
watching him. No doubt he had noticed how he was
acting for the purpose of consuming time. Martin had
never seen the man before, and felt sure that he knew
nothing about him, but had guessed that he had something
to conceal from Mr. Seymour. What could be
done to shake him off?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin knew every inch of this part of London,
lying between the river and his home. A minute or
two after he had assured himself that the man was
indeed dogging him, he turned suddenly into a narrow
court, dropped Gundra’s hand, and telling the boy to
keep pace with him, started to run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was hindered by his basket. The man must
have started to run also, for before the boys had gained
the end of the court the pursuer was hard on their
heels. To make matters worse, he shouted. “ ’Ware!
’ware! Stop, thief!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one was at the moment passing in the court, but
windows flew open, heads looked out, and Martin knew
that it was only a matter of minutes before the chase
would be in full cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dashing out of the court with the Indian, he ran a
few yards along the street, then darted into a narrow
alley on the other side. In a moment he realised the
mistake into which his haste had led him. The place
was a cul-de-sac; there was no opening at the farther
end. He was trapped.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH</h1></div>

<h3>SALLY TAKES A HAND</h3>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment or two Martin felt as a hunted fox might
feel when the chase had driven it into an enclosure from
which there was no escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narrow alley, a sort of tunnel under the houses,
opened into a broader yard, bounded on the one side
by a high blank wall, on the other by the palings of
square grass plots in front of a row of small houses.
At the farther end another wall presented an obstacle
which only a cat could have climbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But just as Martin was on the verge of despair he
caught sight of a familiar figure, and in a flash he saw a
possible chance of safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On one of the grass plots a buxom woman was
bending over a large washtub that stood on a three-legged
stool. A clothes-line, propped on poles, was
extended from a nail in the house-wall to one of the
palings, and from it hung a blue shirt, a pair of stockings,
a spotted neck-cloth, and other articles, pegged
up to dry in the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sally Boulter!” Martin exclaimed, rushing through
the little gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had recognised her as the wife of his friend
Boulter the waterman, to whom she sometimes
brought his dinner to the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please let us come into your house,” he went on
breathlessly. “There’s a man after us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, to be sure!” she cried, keeping her hands in
the tub. “In with you, young master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys ran past her into the open doorway of the
little house. At the same moment the pursuer, red-faced
with running, came out of the alley into the
yard. Apparently he had seen the boys before they
disappeared, for he pounded along straight to Mrs.
Boulter’s gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he reached it he found it closed, and on the
other side of it a strapping young woman, her stout,
muscular arms bared to the shoulder, and in her hands
a blanket which she had just wrung dry. Her lips were
pressed close together, and her friends would have said
that she was in a difficult mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brought up by the gate, the man asked, rather
gaspingly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen a baker’s boy and a blackamoor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I seen—what did you say?” replied Sally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A baker’s boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many a one; baker’s boys aren’t that uncommon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just now, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sally looked up and down the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I can’t see a baker’s boy just now,” she said.
“But if you want a baker’s boy, there’s a baker just
round the corner, and another two streets away. I’m
busy with my man’s washing, so don’t bother me no
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you talk of bothers, mistress,” said the man,
tartly. “You’ll be more bothered yet if you’re not
careful. Didn’t I see the tail-end of the basket going
into your door? The baker’s boy is inside, and the
blackamoor too, and I’ve something to say to them,
so——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He suddenly pushed open the gate, forcing the
woman back a pace, and was starting to run across the
grass towards the house. But Sally was a woman of
spirit. Whirling the roll of blanket round her head she
brought it with a swish across the man’s neck, hurling
him against the washtub. He caught at the rim to
steady himself, disturbing the balance of the tub upon
its stool. It toppled over with a crash, and the man lay
between the stool and the tub in a pool of soapy water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s all this, missus?” cried a bluff voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the doorway stood the burly waterman, Boulter
himself, surveying the scene. Above his breeches he
wore nothing but his shirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wants bakers’ boys and blackamoors, he does,”
answered his wife, jerking her elbow towards the fallen
man. “Pushes in, he does, and upsets my washtub;
clumsy, I call it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He does, does he!” said the waterman, licking his
hands as he stepped out on to the grass. “Bakers’
boys, and blackamoors, <span class='it'>and</span> washtubs, does he?
Pushes in, does he? I’m thinking it’s black eyes what
he really wants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With every sentence he had drawn a step nearer to
the discomfited intruder, who, spluttering with soapsuds,
was still recumbent in the swamp, half-hidden by
the tub.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up!” cried Boulter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man pushed the tub off, and rose slowly to his
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out you go, after that,” the waterman continued,
kicking the man’s hat over the fence into the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man slunk through the gateway, leaving a trail
of soapsuds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Messing up my garden!” growled Boulter, close on
his heels. “Pick up your hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the man had recovered his dripping hat
he set off to run to the alley-way. But Boulter took a
stride forward, seized him by the collar, and marched
him down the yard, prodding him on with regular
applications of a bony knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll learn you to come pushing into decent folk’s
gardens!” said the waterman. “On a Saturday too!
After bakers’ boys and blackamoors! And washtubs!
Spilling the water! You get out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had come to the entrance of the alley, and with
a parting kick sent the man headlong towards the
street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now don’t you tell me nothing,” he said to Martin
when he returned to the house. “I’m much mistook if
I didn’t see this blackamoor aboard that there Portugal
ship, and if I don’t hear no stories I won’t tell no
lies, for there may be questions asked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, Boulter,” said Martin. “Thank you
very much for your help. Will it be safe for us to go
home now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see to that,” said the waterman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He accompanied the boys to the street. Lurking at
the corner stood the pursuer. On seeing Boulter he
shambled away in the direction of the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drawed out of action,” said Boulter with a chuckle.
“You’ve a clear course on t’other tack, and I reckon
you’ll come safe to port.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE NINETEENTH</h1></div>

<h3>GUNDRA DISAPPEARS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Gundra, the Indian boy, had been a silent, nervous
spectator of these scenes. His lean body seemed to be
quivering from top to toe when Martin once more
struck away for home, and the curious glances of the
persons they met brought a scared look into his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cheer up!” said Martin, noticing his timorousness.
“We’ll soon be home, and I’m sure Susan Gollop will be
kind to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the first aspect of Susan Gollop made Gundra
shrink back and clutch Martin by the sleeve. The
good woman was beating a mat on the waste ground at
the rear of the house, and the vigour of her strokes with
the cane, and the fierce set of her mouth, seemed to
promise little kindness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s a poor little Indian boy, Susan,” Martin
began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry me!” Susan interrupted. “I’m late
as it is; Gollop will be roaring for his breakfast in a
minute. And why aren’t you at your work, I’d like to
know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the same, she looked inquisitively at the shrinking
child. Martin, knowing her morning temper of old,
discreetly said nothing, but took Gundra back into the
house, and set him on a stool with a wedge of treacle-cake
from the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Susan came in, flung the mat upon the
floor; then, placing her hands on her hips, stood over
the boys and demanded:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now what’s all this about? Who’s this black
boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s an Indian, and has run away from a ship
where they were ill-using him,” Martin replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sakes alive! And what’s that to do with you,
Martin Leake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to help him. I want you to keep him here
for a day or two, until we can decide what to do with
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do with him? Take him back, to be sure. There’s
no room for a runaway here; you’ll get us all into
trouble; and I can’t afford another mouth to feed.
I’m surprised at you. And you’ll be out of a job again.
What will Mr. Faryner say, neglecting your work like
this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t send him back, Susan, to be thrashed and
half-starved,” Martin began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said no more, for Gundra slipped from the stool,
fell upon his knees, and holding up his bare arms,
pleaded his own cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not go back; not go back!” he cried piteously.
“Me not eat much; me work very, very hard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s them marks on his arms?” said Susan,
suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s he’s been lashed!” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wicked; downright wicked!” Susan exclaimed.
“Poor lamb! What if he is black? But I don’t know
what Gollop will say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment the constable entered the room, his
cheeks well lathered, and shaving-brush in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that squeaky voice I hear?” he said.
“Bless my eyes, who’s this I see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may well ask,” said Susan. “It’s a poor little
creature of a slave boy what’s run away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From that Portugal ship I’ve told you about,”
Martin added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run away, has he?” said Gollop. “Then you’ll
convoy him back as quick as quick. Harbouring
runaways is an offence in law, and as a man of law ’tis
my bounden duty to give him up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For shame, Gollop!” said his wife, now completely
won over. “You and your law! What’s law, I’d like to
know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Law’s your master and my living, woman,” said
Gollop. “Don’t you make any mistake about that.
The boy’s a runaway, and back he goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a hard-hearted monster,” said Susan.
“Look at this!” She seized Gundra by the arm and
drew him towards her husband. “Scars! Look at ’em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show your back, Gundra,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan herself pulled up the boy’s shirt and revealed
livid streaks upon his flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there no law about that?” she demanded
indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The constable stood with his brush poised in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Them Portugals did that!” he cried. “Flog a poor
little shrimp, eh? Sink me if I give ’em another
chance. I’m a freeborn Englishman, I am, and law or
no law, I’ll not give up any mortal soul, black or white,
to be treated that cruel. Cover him up, Sue. Split my
timbers! I’ve never seen anything like it.” He began
to stamp up and down the room, kicking over a stool,
flourishing his soapy brush. “Brutes, that’s what they
are. How dare they run into an English port! Constable
as I am, English seaman I was, and sooner than send
the poor little wretch back into a ship where they treat
them so savage, I’d—I’d——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knocked over a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand your feelings, Gollop,” said Susan
mildly, “but you needn’t smash the furniture. And
you’ll want a steady hand for your shaving, my man.
Just go and make yourself tidy while I get your
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will. Mind you, Sue, that boy stays here till the
ship sails. Don’t you give him up to no one whatsoever.
And keep a still tongue. Don’t go a-babbling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And keep him out of Mr. Seymour’s sight,” said
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Susan in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because—I’ll tell you later on. It’s a long story,
and Mr. Faryner will be in a rage with me if I don’t
hurry back. I’m very late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you can’t help, make the best of,” said
Gollop, as he went back into his bedroom to finish his
interrupted toilet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baker was in an irritable mood when Martin
reached the shop. He had had to find another messenger
to carry the morning’s delivery of bread and
pastries to Mr. Pasqua’s coffee-house. His annoyance
was increased when Martin told him that the <span class='it'>Santa
Maria</span> was taking in cargo in preparation for sailing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve given me no notice,” he said. “But I’ve
given no credit, that’s a blessing. What have you been
doing all this time? Gaping at the sailors, I suppose. I
know you boys—eyes for anything but your proper
work. Get away into the back shop and scrub the floor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was thankful not to be questioned further.
He had half expected that by this time Mr. Faryner
had been informed of his having brought an Indian boy
away from the ship, and he was on thorns for the rest
of the day. But nothing was said about it, and he
left the shop at the usual hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he got home, he found that Gundra was the
centre of interest. Seated on a settle beside Lucy, he
was chatting cheerfully to the little girl, answering her
innumerable questions in his queer, broken English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is such a nice little boy,” she whispered to
Martin. “I am so glad you brought him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gollop, in high good humour, was full of his
praises. She related how eagerly he had made himself
useful, scouring her pots and pans, peeling potatoes,
and even showing her how to cook rice in the Indian way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had made him a shakedown in a cupboard
under the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a dark place,” she said, “and I won’t say but
he’ll have mice for company, but it was the only place
I could think of, and when I’d swept it out he was
quite pleased with it. It’s very stuffy this hot weather,
but I told him to leave the door open when he goes to
bed, or he’ll be stifled. He’s a willing little fellow, that
I will say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day was Sunday, but Martin rose at his
usual hour, because he had to make a round with
fresh hot rolls before the day was his own. He noticed
as he passed the cupboard under the stairs that the
door, which had been open when he said good-night to
the boy, was now nearly closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let it be,” said Susan, upon his telling her.
“Them Indians live in a hot country, by all that’s
said, and he won’t mind the stuffiness. And we won’t
wake him; a long sleep will do him good, poor lamb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin cleaned his boots and ate his breakfast; then,
as he was about to start for the shop, he thought he
would peep into the cupboard and see if the boy was
awake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He listened at the door. There was no sound from
within. Then very cautiously he pulled the door
towards him and looked in. The narrow cupboard
with its sloping roof was in black darkness, and for a
few moments his eyes could not distinguish even the
shakedown on the floor. But presently he was able to
discern its dim outlines, and then he started and
hurriedly entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half a minute later he rushed back into the living-room,
where Mrs. Gollop was cleaning the hearth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Susan,” he cried, “the cupboard is empty. Gundra
has gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gollop was considerably upset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of all the ungrateful little wretches!” she
exclaimed. “Coming here whining and dropping on
his knees, and me making up a bed for him and all—and
then to slink out without a word! I’ll never do
anything for a foreigner again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we don’t know that he slunk out, Susan,”
Martin protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t <span class='it'>know</span>!” she retorted sarcastically. “Did
he say good-bye to <span class='it'>you</span>, then? Did you hear him go?
And I warrant he didn’t go empty-handed, either.
Wait till I count my spoons!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe he’s a thief!” said Martin. “I don’t
believe he ran away. I believe someone got into the
house and took him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, them that took him had a right to him,
didn’t they? A good riddance to bad rubbish! Now
eat your fill, and be off; ’tis your first Sunday with
Mr. Faryner, and he won’t thank you if you’re late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only six o’clock. Gollop had not returned
from his nightly duty, and Lucy was still asleep.
Martin hurriedly swallowed a thick slice of bread-and-dripping,
thinking hard all the time, while Susan
inspected her drawers and cupboards to find evidence
of the Indian boy’s knavery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure he did not go willingly,” thought Martin.
“Mr. Seymour’s man saw him with me, and no doubt
told Mr. Seymour, and he knows Blackbeard, and—oh,
what a puzzle everything is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind was full of the matter as he started for the
shop. He wondered whether Mr. Seymour had let
Blackbeard into the house during the night—whether
the boy was now back on board the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>,
perhaps at that very moment being thrashed by that
fat bully the cook. And he foresaw a very unpleasant
time for himself when he took his bread to the ship on
Monday morning.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE TWENTIETH</h1></div>

<h3>FIRE! FIRE!</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Within a minute or two Martin’s mind was taken off
the fate of the Indian boy by something much more
actual and immediate. On turning the corner he was
aware that there were many more people in the streets
than was usual at that hour on Sunday morning.
They were all hurrying in one direction—the same
direction as himself. There was excitement in their
looks and in the way they spoke to one another; some
appeared to be asking eager questions which those they
addressed were in too great haste to answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught the word Fire!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there a fire? Where is it?” he asked a lad in a
’prentice’s cap who was trotting over the cobblestones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“London Bridge,” panted the lad, and ran on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin began to run too. The crowd grew thicker;
from every street and lane poured men and boys, and a
few women, some only half dressed, all excited, all
eager. From mouth to mouth ran the terrible word
Fire! and as the throng swelled their pace quickened,
and their cries, mingling with the clatter of their shoes,
raised a din that strangely disturbed the Sabbath
quiet of the bright morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be a big fire,” thought Martin, and he remembered
hearing Gollop speak of a fire on London
Bridge when he was a boy, which had burned all night
and destroyed more than forty houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is it? Where is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was repeated again and again as
newcomers joined the crowd. No one seemed to know
with certainty. Some said London Bridge, others
Cannon Street. Nothing could be seen of it. The
streets were narrow, the houses high and overlapping
in their upper storeys; between their tops the sky was
cloudless blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clamour grew louder; every now and then there
were strange popping noises which for a moment
startled the crowd to silence. They ran faster and faster,
jostling one another, pushing aside the less active.
Swept along in the pouring tide, Martin found himself
in Little Eastcheap, and then, far ahead in that
broader thoroughfare, he saw over the roofs a brownish
tinge in the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On and on he ran, his excitement growing with every
step he took. At the corner of Gracechurch Street the
meeting streams of people made so dense a block that
for a while his progress was checked; he was hemmed in
amid a press of stout citizens, unable to see anything
but their backs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His ears were deafened by their shouts, which rose
above the distant roar and crackle. Presently, when he
again began to move onward, he heard a man near him
say, in a loud voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis Pudding Lane, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words were taken up around him. Pudding
Lane! The cry flew from lip to lip, and stirred the
crowd into a vast surging movement southward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pudding Lane! What house, I wonder?” thought
Martin. “The Three Tuns, perhaps; they’ve a lot of
straw in their yard. Or perhaps it’s at Noakes’s, the
oil-man’s. His shop would blaze.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More and more eager to reach the scene of the fire, he
began to push and wriggle and worm his way through
the mob, getting his toes trodden on, and indignant
thrusts and cuffings from those he incommoded. As he
drew nearer to his goal the roar swelled; at moments,
when he was able to look ahead, he saw dense clouds
of smoke, brown and black, sweeping across the housetops
westward, carried swiftly along by the north-east
wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After what seemed to be hours of struggling he
arrived at the corner of Fish Street Hill. The air was
full of smoke and floating blacks and the suffocating
smell of burning. The crowd here was denser than
ever; the din louder and more terrible. Martin, already
half-choked with the smoke, felt that his breath would
be squeezed out of him by the pressure around. But he
pushed and prodded, taking advantage of the least
gap that opened as the throng swayed, and by and by
he managed to force his way to a point where he should
be able to see the houses on Fish Street Hill and in
Pudding Lane opposite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But where were the houses? He rubbed his smarting
eyes, and looked and looked again. There were no
houses any more. Where the great Star Inn had stood,
with its galleries and yards and outbuildings, there was
now nothing but a black smouldering heap. All down
the Hill, all down the Lane, it was the same black waste
and desolation: not a house remained standing. And
as he looked he saw flames burst from the belfry of St.
Magnus Church beyond, and a huge column of smoke
shoot up around its lofty tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The church is ablaze!” roared the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The parsonage too! Save us all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here and there among the throng were persons
wringing their hands and lamenting the loss of all their
possessions. Martin forced his way to one of them,
and asked eagerly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen Mr. Faryner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My house is gone—my house is gone!” was all the
reply he received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went from one to another, repeating his question;
no one knew the whereabouts of the baker. Martin felt
anxious; the house and shop were utterly destroyed,
their site was occupied only by heaps of charred
and smouldering debris. Had Mr. Faryner and his
family and journeyman escaped? It was clear that
the fire must have broken out in the middle of the
night. Had they been taken by surprise and perished
in the flames?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was at a loss what to do. His occupation was
gone; there was no bread for him to carry; he could
learn nothing of his employer, and he debated with
himself whether to stay and watch the progress of the
fire or to run home and tell the Gollops what he had
seen. Deciding for the second course, he turned his
back and tried to fight his way to Gracechurch Street.
But the crowd had enormously increased. There were
no policemen in those days to clear the streets, no
firemen to dash up with their engines and pour water
on the flames. In the churches were kept a few leather
buckets and metal squirts, but they were useless in so
great a conflagration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An eddy in the stream of people carried Martin
into Cannon Street, and he suddenly found himself
pressed against Mr. Faryner’s man. He was swept
past him, but managed to dodge back, and seized his
arm firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Mr. Faryner?” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safe and sound, thank God, with his friend the
mercer in Cheapside,” the man answered. “But he’s
in a terrible state of mind, and no wonder, seeing as the
fire broke out in his shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In our shop?” asked Martin, in amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, about two o’clock this morning. I woke out
of my sleep feeling I was choking, and the place was
full of smoke. I roused the master. We couldn’t get
downstairs, so we had to climb through the garret
window and along a gutter-pipe to the roof next door.
How we did it, Heaven alone knows, and I wouldn’t
venture it again for a thousand pounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What caused the fire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who knows? ’Tis my belief——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this moment there was a cry of “Make way
for the Lord Mayor!” People pushed this way and
that, and in the commotion Martin was torn from the
man’s side and swept along the street. It was hopeless
to attempt to reach him again, or to take a direct
course for home, and Martin allowed himself to drift
on the tide.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIRST</h1></div>

<h3>WHAT SUSAN FOUND</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The circular movement of the crowd brought Martin in
time to a point where he was able to see how swiftly
the fire was spreading. The houses at the end of
London Bridge were ablaze. Between the bridge and
Fishmongers’ Hall was a warren of dilapidated
timber houses intersected by narrow alleys. Into those
passages the strong wind bore sparks and blazing fragments;
the dry wood easily caught fire, and it was evident
that the whole district would soon be a furnace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the inhabitants, at first careless spectators,
were seized with panic fear, and in desperate haste
began to move their goods and furniture from the
doomed houses. From every door they sallied forth,
laden with every article they could carry. There was
a fierce demand for trucks and carts; some people
hastened downhill to the riverside, and besought the
aid of the watermen in conveying their goods out of
harm’s way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This suggested an idea to Martin. Mr. Faryner’s
boat lay at the stairs some distance below the bridge.
Why should he not use it to help the frantic people? He
ought to ask Mr. Faryner’s leave, but it would take
him hours to get through the crowd to the mercer’s
house in Cheapside; indeed, it would be difficult
enough, even by a roundabout route, to reach the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arrival of the Lord Mayor on horseback,
attended by his javelin men, had fortunately thinned
the crowd at the corner of Eastcheap, and Martin, by
dodging and winding, succeeded in making his way
into one of the lanes running down to the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would hardly have been surprised to find that
the boat had already been taken away; but it was in its
usual place, padlocked to the post. Springing in, he
rowed out upon the river, which was already crowded
with craft of all kinds: the wherries of the watermen,
who would reap a rich harvest to-day: the barges of
fine gentlemen come to view the spectacle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin pulled over to the Surrey side, to avoid the
sparks and burning masses that were falling from the
houses at the northern end of the bridge, shot through
one of the arches, and rowed across to the other shore.
The fire was speeding westward like a devouring
monster. He observed the flames leaping from house to
house; the smoke, driven before the wind, already reaching
past Blackfriars; the blazing particles that were
whirled up and round, and fell hissing into the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waterside was thronged with people clamouring
for watermen, even throwing their goods into the
water. When Martin pulled in to the nearest stairs he
had to keep an oar’s length distant to prevent his boat
from being overcrowded and swamped, and it was only
after some argument and even altercation that he was
able to take on board an old man and woman with all
their little wealth tied up in huge bundles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having rowed them to Westminster, where they had
a married daughter, and refused pay, he returned, and
again selected the older people from those who besought
his services. Time after time he went up and
down the river, finding it more and more difficult to
steer a course among the hundreds of craft, large and
small, that almost blocked the waterway. And on
shore the roar and crackle of the flames mingled with
the cries and lamentations of homeless people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, tired and hot and hungry, Martin pulled his
empty boat down stream, fastened it to its post at
the stairs which, being behind the fire, were deserted,
and dragged himself wearily homeward. It was long
past his dinner-time, but Susan Gollop had kept
food waiting for him and for her husband, who had
not yet returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s come of the man?” she said, when Martin
entered the room. “Stopping to see the fire they’re
talking about, I suppose. And you’re as black as a
sweep. What have you been doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Helping to save people’s goods,” Martin replied.
“It’s a frightful fire, Susan; hundreds of houses burnt
already, and there’s no stopping it while the wind’s so
strong. Mr. Faryner’s house is burnt down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious me! What’ll you do for your living now?
Where did this dratted fire start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At our shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, to be sure! Some careless wretch didn’t rake
out the embers, I warrant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we be burnt, Martin?” asked Lucy, timorously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not, child,” Susan interposed. “It’s far
enough off, and the wind blows it away from us, thank
goodness. I don’t know what the world’s coming to,
what with fires, and men who won’t come in to their
vittles, and dark doings under the stairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” Martin asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, look at this: what do you make of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held up a large brass button, to which were
attached a few threads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” said Martin, wondering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not well: it’s a mystery. That’s a button
from a man’s coat, and I found it in the cupboard
under the stairs. I went in with a candle to take down
the bed that Indian boy slept in, and tidy up, and
there was the button a-shining on the floor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that boy had no buttons: his clothes was all
rags and strings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may have been there before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I’m sure it wasn’t, for I swept out the place
myself for the boy. I ask you, how did that button
come in my cupboard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell, and it doesn’t matter much. By the
look of it it’s been torn off. I’ll just eat my dinner and
then go off and see if I can find Gollop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martin did not find Gollop, nor indeed did he
look very earnestly for him, so much interested was he
in watching the fire. Soldiers, horse and foot, had
been sent from Westminster to keep order in the streets.
At the King’s command houses were being pulled down
to stay the course of the flames. The streets were
clogged with carts and barrows laden with the goods of
fugitives. And the crowds were now declaring that the
fire was the work of foreigners, and clamouring for
vengeance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late in the evening when Martin, tired out,
once more reached home. Meeting the old Frenchman
on the doorstep, he mentioned the excitement about
foreigners, and suggested that his friend should avoid
the crowds. Mounseer smiled and thanked him, but
showed no signs of concern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood on the doorstep watching the glow in the
sky. It was a dark night, but every now and then a
burst of flame in the distance lit up the street. Presently
Mr. Seymour came along from the direction of
the river. As he reached the foot of the steps a sudden
brief illumination fell upon him. And in that moment
Martin noticed that the top button of Mr. Seymour’s
coat was missing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Seymour halted, and, dangling his tasselled cane,
said with a pleasant smile: “A magnificent spectacle,
is it not? And we need not pay for seats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you say, sir,” replied the Frenchman coldly,
turning to enter the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was trying to see clearly the kind of buttons
on Mr. Seymour’s coat, but that gentleman had faced
about, so that his back was towards the fire, and the
glow in the sky had dulled a little. In order to detain
him, Martin asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are we quite safe here, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman heard the question, and turned at
the door, as if waiting with some anxiety for the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s not a doubt of it,” said Mr. Seymour. “We
are a good distance behind the fire, and the east wind
is driving it from us along the waterside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had paid little attention to Mr. Seymour’s
answer, so eager was he to satisfy himself as to the
nature of the buttons. Mounseer, apparently reassured,
had disappeared. Wheeling round to follow him into
the house, Mr. Seymour came for a moment within the
illumination from the red sky, and Martin almost jumped
as he noticed that the buttons appeared to be made of
the same metal as the one that Susan Gollop had found.
They seemed also to be the same size, but of that he
was not quite so sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went into the house behind Mr. Seymour,
watched him ascend to the upper floor, then ran down
the basement stairs. Mrs. Gollop had prepared supper,
and there was a look of disappointment on her face
when she saw Martin enter alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen Gollop?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, I haven’t,” Martin replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has become of the man? I’m beginning to
worrit. He’s such a regular man for his meals. He’s
never missed his Sunday dinner since he came home
from sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that his step?” said Martin, running to the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heavy, dragging footsteps were heard on the stairs.
Lucy jumped up and joined her brother: Mrs. Gollop
stood in her place, and with a quick lift of her apron
wiped the corners of her eyes.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND</h1></div>

<h3>THE EMPTY ROOM</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The constable tumbled rather than walked into the
room. His hands and clothes were begrimed and
black; his hat was crushed and shapeless; his fat, rosy
cheeks were streaked with irregular patterns where his
fingers had rubbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan Gollop stood with arms akimbo, grimly
eyeing the returned wanderer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you’re not a pretty object!” she said
severely; but her lips were trembling a little. “There!
Fetch a basin of water, Lucy, and the pummy stone,
and there’s a dirty towel on the rack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick Gollop plumped heavily into a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m dead beat, missus,” he murmured. “Give us a
drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin handed him a mug, and he took a deep
draught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a Sunday!” he exclaimed. “Fire and
brimstone! The everlasting fire! And the Lord
Mayor’s just as silly as any common man. My throat’s
as dry as a bone. Another drink, lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you talk lightly of the Lord Mayor, my
man,” said his wife reproachfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pish! He’s scared out of his wits, no good at all.
The King’s the man for my money. ’Twas he sent
orders to pull down houses so’s the fire wouldn’t have
nothing to feed on; but bless me! the Lord Mayor goes
up and down wringing his hands and crying, ‘What
can I do?’ But I’m dead beat, I say: all day and all
night at it; I’ll drop asleep where I sit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon,” said the Frenchman’s voice in the doorway.
“You are of return. Tell me, I pray, the house:
is it safe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worrit about the house, Mounseer,” said
Gollop. “There’s more call to worrit about yourself.
Keep below deck, that’s my advice to you. The
people are raging about all foreigners, specially French
and Dutch, and if they catch you in the street, ten to one
they’ll do you a mischief. I saw a Frenchman nearly
torn limb from limb by a parcel of women because he
was carrying fire-balls, they said. Turned out to be
tennis-balls; that’s their ignorance. Don’t go out,
Mounseer: what you can’t help, make the best of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman smiled and thanked him, and returned
to his own apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re sure we’re safe, Gollop?” said Susan. “We
can go to sleep in our beds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure I’m going to sleep in mine,” answered Gollop.
“One more drink, then——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re so sure, why’s that Mr. Seymour so frightened,
then? He’s been going in and out all day; men
have been traipsing up and down, carrying out boxes
and parcels and things. <span class='it'>He’s</span> not so sure, seemingly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mention of Mr. Seymour reminded Martin of the
button.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Susan,” he said, “where’s that button you
found in the cupboard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless the boy! What’s buttons to do with it? It’s
on the mantelshelf, if you must know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin reached it down, examined it, and in a
moment exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Mr. Seymour’s. His top button is missing.
I saw him as he came in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” said Susan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gundra must have torn it off. It was Mr. Seymour
spirited him away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever! You hear that, Gollop?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh? What?” said Gollop, who was beginning to
doze in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Indian boy was carried off in the night, and
’twas Mr. Seymour done it. Poor little wretch! That’s
kidnapping. You can’t go to sleep yet: what’s your
precious law say to that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The law says,” muttered Gollop drowsily, “what
you can’t help, make——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to me,” said his wife, shaking him. “You’ll
just go upstairs at once with this button and show it to
that Seymour, and ask him what he means by——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Avast there, woman!” cried the constable, heaving
himself out of his chair. “I’ll sheer off to my bed and
nowhere else, not for all the laws in the kingdom. Talk
of buttons and nigger boys when all the world is afire!
I’m dead-beat, I say, and I’ll turn in this minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lurched away into the bedroom and shut the
door with a bang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan looked at the door as if in a mind to follow her
husband and drag him back. Then her face softened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor dear!” she said. “He’s that tired I never did
see, and when a man’s tired let him be, that’s what I
say. But that there Seymour!” Her lips shut tight.
“Gollop can’t go, so I’ll go myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t tell you anything,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he will, maybe he won’t. But I’ll not rest
till I know what he’s done with that poor shrimp of a
blackamoor. And if he won’t tell, leastways I’ll show
him the button, and ask whether he owns it, and I
warrant I’ll tell by the look on his face whether he’s a
villain or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go with you—light you upstairs,” said Martin,
taking a candle from the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to bed, Lucy,” said Susan. “You are over-late
already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to know about the Indian boy,” said Lucy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, don’t make me cross. Go to bed at once;
you shall hear all about it in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smoothing her apron and setting her cap straight,
Mrs. Gollop marched out of the room, Martin following
with the candle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I’ll</span> talk to him!” said the angry woman, as she
began to climb the stairs. “<span class='it'>I’ll</span> teach him to come
stealing down in the dead of night and poking his nose
into the rooms of honest people! <span class='it'>I’ll</span> give him a piece
of my mind, and his ears will be all of a tingle before
he’s done with Susan Gollop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin noticed with amusement that the higher
she got the lower fell the tone of her voice, until by the
time she reached Mr. Seymour’s door and knocked,
and asked, “Can I speak to you, sir?” her voice was as
mild as the cooing of a dove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer. She knocked again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Seymour, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was still no answer. She waited a moment or
two, then summoned up her resolution and turned the
handle. To her surprise the door opened. The room
was dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show me a light,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, with the candle, stepped in front of her. A
glance showed that the room was empty, except of the
furniture and a quantity of litter on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I declare!” Susan cried, in loud indignation.
“He’s gone, and took all his belongings. There’s a
coward for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the litter there were a few pieces of paper,
suggesting that Mr. Seymour had torn up old letters
before he left. Martin, all his suspicions revived, had
the curiosity to collect these scraps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can do nothing more,” he said. “I’d like to
look at these bits of paper carefully downstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re just love-letters or other rubbidge,”
scoffed Mrs. Gollop, “and I’ve come up all these stairs
for nothing at all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But half an hour later Martin, poring over the papers
spread before him on the table by the light of two
candles, was inclined to think that the journey had not
been in vain. He had put together a number of scraps
that appeared to be all in the same handwriting, and by
shifting their positions until the torn edges fitted
together he had composed a sentence or two that
clearly formed part of a letter. What he read was as
follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Maria sails on Tuesday. All cargo must be
stowed by Monday. Tell W. S. that I do not communicate
with him direct, for reasons which .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no more. Martin was at no loss to understand
that the vessel sailing on Tuesday was the <span class='it'>Santa
Maria</span>; nor was it long before he came to another
conclusion. W. S. were the initials of his old employer,
William Slocum.</p>

<h3>’PRENTICES TO THE RESCUE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Dick Gollop and Martin both rose very late next
morning. They left the house together, but soon parted,
the former to return to his duty, the latter to resume
his self-imposed office of helping people in need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fire was still raging unchecked, and was
spreading from the riverside streets towards the heart of
the city. Many people who had indulged a careless belief
in the safety of their dwellings had now flown to the
opposite extreme of panic and despair, and the supply
of carts, barrows, and wherries was hopelessly unequal
to the demands of those anxious to save their goods.
The streets in every direction were blocked by frantic
fugitives, and the fields north of the city were already
dotted with the encampments of homeless people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Martin reached the stairs where he had left
his boat he found that it had disappeared. It was
hopeless to look for it among the hundreds that were
plying on the river, and Martin, feeling himself
deprived of his occupation, made his way westwards,
first with the idea of inquiring after Mr. Faryner, and
then of getting a view of the progress of the Fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he was jostling his way among the crowds who
were moving up Cheapside, he was thrown against
the old Frenchman, struggling along in the opposite
direction. It flashed into his mind that Mounseer
might have been paying another visit to Mr. Slocum,
and his former feeling of puzzlement returned with
redoubled force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my friend, what do you here?” asked the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My boat has been taken,” replied Martin, looking
around rather anxiously; for the Frenchman’s words
must have been heard by the persons near him, and his
accent, coupled with the cut of his clothes and his
general appearance, would certainly betray him as a
foreigner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you have nothing to do,” the Frenchman
continued. “Same as me; your little sister go not to the
school to-day, therefore am I unoccupied. I enjoy the
holiday,” he added, with a smile. “We shall enjoy it
together, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hadn’t you better go home, sir?” said Martin,
remembering what Gollop had said overnight about
the mob’s treatment of foreigners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, not at all. This great sight interest me
very much. You shall take me to a place where the
spectacle is most beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin noticed one or two people scowling, and wished
that Mounseer would hold his tongue. Determined to
draw him away from the main stream of traffic he
turned into an alley-way, intending to go by back
streets as far as St. Paul’s, where, perhaps, the sacristan
might allow them to ascend the tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their course led them past the back entrance to Mr.
Greatorex’s premises. Just before they reached it a
man came out and walked towards Cheapside. Martin
and the Frenchman recognised him at the same
moment; he was the man whose scarred face they had
seen at the window—the man who had knocked Martin
down in Whitefriars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What next?” thought Martin. This was a new
shock of surprise. Was this man also among Mr. Slocum’s
acquaintances? The idea would never have occurred
to Martin but for his thorough distrust of Mr. Slocum,
and a strange suspicion was dawning on his mind when
his attention was diverted by a sudden movement of
the Frenchman, who hurried after the man, seized his
arm, and began to speak excitedly in French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stared, swore, caught sight of Martin, then
suddenly shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frenchy! Ho, boys, here’s one of the foreign spies
what sets us afire. Down with all Frenchies!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were near the end of the lane, and the man’s
words were heard and taken up by the crowd in
Cheapside. A number of roughs surged towards them,
and the accuser, finding himself supported, turned on
the Frenchman, dealt him a violent blow, and started
to tear his coat off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Away, you coward!” cried Martin, rushing forward
to help the old gentleman; but a burly ruffian
caught him in his arms and hurled him back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment there was a cry from behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s Martin Leake! Clubs! Clubs! ’Prentices
to the rescue!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tall figure dashed past Martin, who was staggering
under the big man’s assault, and with doubled fists
attacked the aggressor with a whirling ferocity that
drove him back reeling. In the lad who had come to
his help Martin recognised his fellow-'prentice and
opponent, George Hopton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next moment from several doors in the neighbourhood
darted one or more flat-capped ’prentices brandishing
the clubs from which they took their rallying
cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For centuries the London ’prentices had been
renowned for their prowess in faction fights among
themselves and against the rougher elements of the
population. The street now rang with the cry “Clubs!
Clubs!” and those formidable weapons were soon
thudding on the heads and shoulders of the rabble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman had fallen to the ground, but rose
when his assailant turned to defend himself against the
’prentices, and leant, bruised and shaken, against the
wall. The success of the ’prentices’ attack was due to
its suddenness rather than its strength. There were
only about six of them altogether, and the man with
the scar, seeing that no more were joining them, again
raised his cry of “Down with all Frenchies!” and called
on all true Englishmen to support him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the crowd had increased, and several
truculent fellows broke from it and rushed towards the
fight. They were heavier metal than the ’prentice
lads; soon they outnumbered them; the little band
was forced back step by step, some of them losing their
clubs to the enemy. The combat swept past the old
Frenchman, carrying Martin with it, and in a few
moments the ’prentices would have suffered a disastrous
rout had not a loud shout in a tone of authority
imposed a sudden peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All eyes were turned upon the speaker, an elderly
gentleman wearing a well-curled periwig, and a coat of
purple cloth, and carrying a gold-headed cane which he
brandished at the crowd. Martin recognised him as the
important customer of Mr. Slocum’s who had been
hustled in the course of his fight with George Hopton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back, rascals!” cried the gentleman. “Are you
fools enough to believe these absurd tales of foreign
incendiaries? I tell you there’s no ground for them.
Foreigners in our midst should be treated as guests.
Your conduct is a disgrace to Englishmen and citizens
of London. Away with you, and find something useful
to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah for Mr. Pemberton!” cried the ’prentices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The combatants shamefacedly drew back and
mingled with the more peaceable spectators. Martin
hurried to the old Frenchman’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! You again!” said Mr. Pemberton, recognising
him. “Are you always fighting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I owe my life to him and the others,” began
Mounseer.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/img-119.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0005' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better go home, sir,” was the reply, “and
remain within doors while men’s minds are affected by
this great calamity. As for you lads, I hope, though I
don’t expect, that you will always use your clubs in as
good a cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved away, followed by another cheer from the
’prentices, and Martin started to accompany the
Frenchman home, supporting him on his arm. George
Hopton and one or two other ’prentices set off to see
them a little distance on their way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments they became aware that the man
with the scar was skulking after them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoop!” cried Hopton. “Clubs! Clubs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his fellow ’prentices he turned and chased the
man, who did not wait their onslaught, but dived into
a narrow entry and disappeared. And all the way
home Martin was wondering what the baffled ruffian
had to do with Mr. Slocum.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FOURTH</h1></div>

<h3>MR. SLOCUM MOVES AT LAST</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Anxious to avoid any repetition of the attack on
Mounseer, Martin conducted the old gentleman across
Cheapside into Wood Street, intending to go home by
way of Aldermanbury and Cripplegate, though it
involved a long round. George Hopton accompanied
them for some little distance, then he stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, I must go back,” he said, “or Slocum will be
in a rage. I don’t know what’s come to him. He seems
to have lost his wits. Most of the other goldsmiths have
removed their valuables to the Tower, and Slocum has
been urged to do the same. But he refuses. ‘Time
enough, time enough,’ he says, ‘the Fire is by the
river; it may not reach as far as Cheapside.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he’s wrong,” said Martin. “What’s to
stop it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what everybody says. But his answer is
that the goods are safer in the vaults than they’d be if
he moved them; there are thieves about. That’s true
enough; I’ve heard of several shops having been
robbed. But though Slocum talks like that he has been
packing the stock. At least, I suppose he has; he
hasn’t asked for any help from me. He was in the
strong-room nearly all day yesterday, alone, and we
heard hammering time after time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not so stupid after all,” Martin rejoined.
“I suppose he talks to keep up other people’s courage,
though he’s making preparations to go. But he’ll be
lucky if he gets a cart. There are so many doing the
same thing that there aren’t enough carts to go round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must go,” said Hopton, adding in a
whisper: “Keep the old man indoors. I mayn’t be at
hand next time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks for your help,” said Martin, with a smile:
Hopton certainly did not suffer from an excess of
modesty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mounseer himself seemed to have realised at last that
his friends had given him good advice. He walked
quickly, begged Martin to keep close to him, and
declared that he would not stir from the house again
until the Fire had ceased and the excitement died down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they reached home they found Dick Gollop
snatching a meal. He told Martin that the services of
the constables were not so necessary in the streets now
that the troops had arrived to keep order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s a terrible calamity,” he said, “and I’m
afeard we’re not near the end yet. The flames are
spreading: they’ve got across Cannon Street, and I
was pretty near stifled as I came through Bucklersbury
by the stench from the druggists’ shops. I passed
the back of your old place, Martin. Does Mr. Seymour
know Slocum?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I saw him coming out of the door. There
was a sneaking way about him. ‘Hallo!’ thinks I,
‘has my fine gentleman been to pawn something?’
Then I thought maybe he knew Slocum, though you’ve
never said you saw him at the shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin thought it was time to acquaint the constable
with what he knew of the relations between Slocum
and Seymour and the captain of the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>.
He spoke of Blackbeard’s visits by night, and the brass-bound
boxes, and the meeting in Mr. Pasqua’s coffee-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to have told me all that before,” said
Gollop reproachfully when the story was concluded.
“Me being a man of law, ’twould have been proper I
should know of them queer goings on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did try, but you shut me up,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I did. I was wrong. I own it; dash my sleepy
head! Never you sleep your brains away, my lad.
Them brass boxes, now. There’s no telling what
mischief’s in them boxes. Still, what you can’t help,
make the best of, and I say no more for the present.
When the Fire’s over maybe I’ll look into things a bit:
I’ve no time for it now—indeed, I must get back to my
duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went out hurriedly, before Martin had related
what had happened to the old Frenchman. Susan and
Lucy, when that story was told, were both indignant
at the crowd’s treatment of their friend, and nothing
would satisfy the girl but that she must take him a
bowl of syllabub to comfort him, as she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was too restless to remain indoors. The
fascination of the Fire drew him again into the streets,
which were now still more congested, the stream of
fugitives hurrying to the fields meeting a stream of
countrymen whom the prospect of making money by
hiring out their carts had drawn to the City. The roar
of the flames, the crash of falling houses, the cries and
oaths of the people struggling to save their goods, the
smells from burning oil and spices, the blazing flakes
fantastically whirling in the wind, made up a series of
vivid impressions that remained in Martin’s memory
for many a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards evening he found himself again in the
neighbourhood of Mr. Slocum’s house. He had not
gone there of set purpose, but had been drawn there
unconsciously, perhaps, by a vague recollection of
Dick Gollop’s remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going down the lane towards the back entrance, he
was brought to a halt by the sight of a large hand-truck
at the door. The three ’prentices, in their shirt sleeves,
were loading it with boxes under the direction of Mr.
Slocum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s scared at last,” thought Martin. “But what a
strange time to choose for going away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remained in a shady corner, watching. It was
certainly high time that the goldsmith’s valuables
were removed, for the Fire had reached the foot of the
streets leading up to Cheapside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The loading was finished a few minutes after Martin’s
arrival, and the ’prentices put on their coats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I not to come, sir?” Martin heard Hopton say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; you are to stay and guard the shop. Jenks and
Butler can wheel the truck. Too many of us would
attract attention, and the dusk will bring out the
thieves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw a sheet over the truck, tying it down at the
corners. So far as appearance went, the load might
have consisted only of household goods like those
which hundreds of citizens had been moving all the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two younger ’prentices seized the handles of the
truck and wheeled it up the lane. Martin, shrinking
back in his corner, noticed that Mr. Slocum, walking
close behind, had a pistol projecting from his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had turned into Cheapside, Martin went
up to Hopton as he was going back to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo!” said Hopton. “Is the Frenchman in
trouble again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; he won’t stir out again,” replied Martin. “So
Slocum has moved at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lunatic! Why didn’t he go earlier? He’ll have
to make a long round to get to the Tower, and it will be
nearly dark before he arrives: just the time for footpads
to attack him. There’s nobody left in the house,
or I’d follow and see that he gets there safely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go,” said Martin, once more amused at Hopton’s
idea of his own importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hopton gave a snort. “What could you do if they
were attacked?” he asked. “You’ve no weapons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I could shout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go, then. It’s no concern of yours, but you might
raise a hullabaloo if anything happens. I suppose I
must kick my heels here until Slocum releases me,
though I promise you I won’t stay if the flames come
anywhere near.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin set off, but during the minute or two he had
been talking with Hopton the barrow had passed out of
sight among the thronging people. Knowing that it
must take a northerly direction in order to skirt the
Fire, he crossed Cheapside and dodged his way into
Milk Street, the nearest of the streets branching out
of the main thoroughfare. There was no sign of the
barrow, yet it could not have got far, owing to the
crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struck into a by-lane and came to Wood Street.
The crowd here was not so thick, and he was able to
move more quickly. At the corner of Silver Street he
stopped and looked round on all sides. The evening
gloom was already descending, though the glow in the
sky lit up the over-arching houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never find them now,” he thought. But just
at that moment the grinding of wheels on the cobbles
drew his attention. He glanced round and saw the
barrow coming along from the direction of the Guildhall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They tried that way and couldn’t get through, I
suppose,” he said to himself, and slipped into the
entrance of a yard until the barrow had passed. “Now
to keep them in sight.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIFTH</h1></div>

<h3>MARTIN FOLLOWS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Martin could hardly have explained why he felt so
keenly interested in the progress of the barrow.
Mr. Slocum was only doing what most of the goldsmiths
had already done, and it was certainly his duty
to save the property of his master, Mr. Greatorex. But
recent incidents had inspired Martin with so deep a
distrust of Mr. Slocum that he was determined not to
lose sight of him until the barrow had safely entered
the portals of the Tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept far enough behind not to be observed, yet
close enough to run no risk of missing the party again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad I’m not shoving the barrow,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The air that summer evening was hot, and its
oppressiveness was enhanced by the pervasive smell of
burning. Martin followed the toiling ’prentices into
Aldersgate Street and turned after them into London
Wall, expecting them to swing to the right at Bishopsgate,
and so finish their long round to the Tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his surprise, they took the eastward direction,
and struck into a winding lane that would bring them,
certainly, to the river, but at a point far away from
their supposed destination. Martin was conscious of a
growing curiosity, even of excitement. The lane was
narrow, and as the dusk was deepening he lessened the
distance between him and the barrow. But a little
farther on, where the lane made a sharp curve, he hung
back for a moment to give the party time to get well
round the corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he did so a man came suddenly round on the
inside of the curve, brushed past him, and continued
his course up the lane towards the main street. Martin
glanced round; the man was fast disappearing into the
dusk, but there was something in his shape and gait
that reminded Martin vaguely of someone he had
seen, he could not remember when or where. The
impression passed in a moment, and he hurried on,
anxious not to lose sight of his quarry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning the corner, he found himself between
parallel lines of tall warehouses, some flush with the
lane, others standing back behind small yards in which
goods were no doubt unloaded. He had not taken
many steps when he heard shrill cries ahead, and broke
into a run, wondering why thieves had been attracted
to so quiet a spot, remote from the crowds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some thirty yards ahead the lane made another
sharp twist. When Martin reached the bend he was
just in time to see, dimly in the fading light, one of the
’prentices being shoved by a man through the gateway
of a warehouse yard. The barrow, Mr. Slocum,
and the other ’prentice were already out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin recognised the voice of the lad who was being
roughly used as that of Butler, and he dashed on at his
topmost speed, shouting as he ran. For a moment he
had no other thought than to save the lad who had
been his fellow-'prentice from the hands of his assailant.
But before he gained the scene the wooden gate
was banged to; he heard the grating of a bolt and
Butler’s protesting cries as he was lugged across the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked up. The gate and the wall on either side
of it were at least ten feet high; their tops were
studded with nails or jagged glass; even if he found a
foothold it would be impossible to scale them. He
banged at the door, still shouting; but there was no response.
Work in the warehouse was over for the day, and
no doubt any workmen or loungers who might ordinarily
have been about were far away, watching the Fire. The
cries of Butler had ceased; within the yard all was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feeling that to knock or shout any longer here would
merely be wasting time, Martin wondered whether he
could find admittance at the back of the warehouse.
He ran on a few yards and came upon a narrow passage
striking off at right angles to the lane. At a venture he
turned into this, and found himself within a few moments
in a lane that evidently ran parallel with the one he had
left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had only just rounded the corner when he heard
the rattling of cart wheels on the cobbles at the river-end
of the lane, and caught sight of a few strange
figures dimly outlined against the background of sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop thief!” he shouted, dashing down the lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some minutes he had been so confused that he
only now guessed that Mr. Slocum’s barrow had
entered by the gateway through which Butler had
been forced; otherwise it could scarcely have disappeared
so suddenly. As he ran, calling for help, he
noticed that a large gateway, with a wicket beside it,
stood wide open on his left. He rushed up to the first
man he overtook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is villainy going on,” he said. “Help me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m helping myself,” the man growled; and the
strangeness of his figure was accounted for by the huge
bundle he carried on his back. He was one of the
fugitives who were conveying their possessions to the
river in the hope of finding a boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin ran on, and in the fast-gathering darkness
cannoned into another man laden almost as heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind your steps!” shouted the man; and with his
free hand he dealt Martin a blow that sent him staggering
against the wall. Recovering himself he dashed
on, his cries to one and another going unheeded.
People were too much concerned with their own troubles
to regard the vague demands of a lad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly he found himself on the edge of a
little quay stretching into the river. There was a
reddish glow reflected from the water, and by this light
he recognised, at the farther end of the quay, the handcart
he had lost sight of. It was standing deserted. A
boat was putting off, piled with boxes. The glow of
the fire glinted on their brass-bound corners and on
the swarthy face of Blackbeard, who held the tiller
strings while two other men rowed steadily down
stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the quay there were two or three other boats
into which fugitive citizens were dumping their goods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Row after that boat!” Martin cried to the watermen.
“It contains stolen goods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the only one,” chuckled one of the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things of great value,” Martin persisted, looking
round in vain to find a waterman whom he knew.
“The owner will reward you richly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out of my way,” cried the man with whom Martin
had collided. “What’s your fare, waterman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five shillings a mile,” the man replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a shark, making your profit out of other
folk’s calamities. But I suppose I must pay you,
though ’tis five times the proper price. Take this
bundle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing that the watermen were too intent on present
gain to trouble about a visionary reward, Martin
turned away. And then he asked himself, what had
become of Slocum and the other ’prentice? They were
certainly not with Blackbeard in the boat. Was it
possible that they too had been carried prisoners into
the warehouse?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He retraced his steps and came to the large gateway
which he had guessed to be the main entrance to the
warehouse. It was now closed, as was also the wicket
at the side. He was trying the latch when a man came
up behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want to get in, eh? Well, so you shall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin turned hastily, and recognised with alarm
the sinister face of the man with the scar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he could recover his wits he was seized in an
iron grip. His captor inserted a key in the lock of the
wicket gate, turned it, and snarling: “Oh, you shall
get in, you shall,” pushed Martin before him into the
yard.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SIXTH</h1></div>

<h3>PRISONERS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Just inside the gate, on the right, was a small brick
cabin, where during working hours the gatekeeper
attended for the purpose of checking merchandise that
entered or left the yard. It was now closed; its window
was shuttered; but a streak of light shone between the
door and the lintel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grasping Martin firmly with one hand, with the other
the man unlocked the door, and pushed his prisoner in.
An oil lamp stood on a table, and on a chair near it sat
Mr. Slocum. He started up on seeing Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavens above! Have they caught you too?” he
exclaimed, with an air of genuine surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin glanced from him to his captor, and caught a
fleeting grin on that man’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how came you in this unhappy plight?”
Slocum went on, speaking very rapidly. “Why should
the wretches attack you? In my own case the explanation
is simple. I set out to save Mr. Greatorex’s
property from this disastrous Fire, with Jenks and
Butler; you remember them? We were suddenly
rushed upon by half a dozen footpads, hustled into the
yard, and while I was shut up here the ’prentice lads
were taken—who knows where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not far,” said the man, grinning again. “Not
so very far. You can see ’em out in the yard there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed through the open doorway. Shading his
eyes against the light, Martin saw dimly two figures
with their backs to the wall, and a big fellow apparently
standing guard over them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can cheer each other up,” said the man, going
out and locking the door behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A monstrous outrage!” said Slocum. “But what
have the villains against you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to know that myself,” said Martin, cautiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were passing up from the waterside, no
doubt?” said Slocum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I was going the other way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange coincidence! You saw the ruffians attack
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I did not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s answers were short. He guessed that the
object of Slocum’s questions were to ascertain how
much he knew, and though he had been almost taken
in by Slocum’s manner, he now suspected that his surprise
had been feigned, and that he was playing a part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it is a gross attack on our personal liberty,”
Slocum continued; “and I won’t stand it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose with an air of grim determination, and
hammered sharply on the door. The man with the
scar entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough of this foolery!” said Slocum, elbowing
the man from the doorway. “Let me out, fellow. I
warn you that you are incurring punishment of the
highest severity in holding two citizens in durance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it easy; none of your shoving,” said the man.
“You can’t go out without I get orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Orders! From whom do you get your orders?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my look-out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are insolent, fellow! Don’t dare to use that
tone to me! I will not put up with insolence from a
ruffian and a gaol-bird!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you a-calling a gaol-bird?” said the man,
scowling fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had already suspected that the men were
play-acting. It now seemed that the captor had
forgotten his part, and was taking Slocum’s expressions
seriously. Slocum realised that he had gone too far
with a person of limited intelligence, and hastened to
reassure him by pantomimic signs which, slight as they
were, did not pass unobserved by Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I demand to be taken outside,” Slocum went on.
“I want air. What with the hot evening and the
stinking lamp this place is suffocating.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve no orders to stifle you,” said the man.
Thereupon, he took Slocum by the sleeve and marched
him out into the yard. Martin was following, but the
man turned at the door, thrust him back, and locked
him in. “Your turn presently,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin sat down on the chair. He was convinced
that Slocum and the man were acting in collusion, and
supposed that their object was to retain him for an
hour or two until the boat conveying Mr. Greatorex’s
valuables had got away. Remembering that the <span class='it'>Santa
Maria</span> was to sail next day, he felt sure that those
valuables would form part of her freight, the fruits of a
conspiracy in which Slocum, Blackbeard, and Seymour
were concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Waiting in the hot, stuffy room soon became tedious
and uncomfortable. Martin got up and tried the
door and the window; both were securely fastened
against him. Presently he heard voices outside, the
creaking of the gate, and the rattle of wheels on the
cobbles of the yard. A minute or two later the key was
turned in the lock, the door was thrown open, and three
men, one of them the man with the scar, who was now
carrying a lantern, stamped into the room. They stood
for a moment looking at Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not leave him here?” said one of them.
“ ’Twill save trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t do,” said the man with the scar. “There’ll
be folk about in the morning; he’ll be found, and then—you
see he knows too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, why not shut his mouth? The river’s
handy. With a stone round his neck——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stow your gab, Bill,” interrupted the other irritably.
“We can’t drown ’em all. Besides, orders is
orders, so you’d better set about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had risen at their entrance, and stood facing
them, his heart beating rather quickly and his cheeks
flushing as he listened to this frank discussion of his
fate. He was not prepared for what happened. The
man who had wished to save trouble made a sudden
pounce, flung his arm round Martin’s neck, and deftly
slipped a gag into his mouth. He was then tripped up,
and as he lay on the floor his hands were roped together,
and he was shoved into a sack that covered him
completely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus bundled up, he was carried into the yard and
dumped into the handcart, which had been brought
empty from the quay. The cart jolted over the
cobbles; he heard the gate slammed behind him, and
wondered to what destination the men had orders to
convey him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The jolting did not last long. In a minute or two the
legs of the handcart were let down with a bump, and
Martin was hoisted out. His head being covered, he
could not see where he had been brought, but he felt
himself being carried downstairs, then flung down upon
boards that rocked under his weight. He was in a
boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He judged by their voices that two of the three men
got into the boat after him. It moved away, and
through the sack he heard the men talking of matters
he knew nothing about. After a journey that seemed
much longer than it was the boat stopped; he felt its
side grate against stone. He was lifted out and carried
up a few steps, then for some yards on the level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more he was set down. There was a knock
upon a door; after an interval of waiting the bolts were
drawn; some words were exchanged between his
bearers and the man who had opened; then he was
carried along, up a flight of stairs, and finally dropped
roughly to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut the sack open,” said one of the men. “Better
give him some air and take the gag out,” he added.
“He won’t do no harm now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The string was cut, and the sack pulled down to his
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Best tie him up,” said one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can’t get away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that; let’s make it sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rope was tied round the middle of the sack, and
knotted to a staple in the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now all’s snug,” said a man. “We’ve lost enough
time over him; let’s get back to the City; we ought to
be able to prig a thing or two out of those fine shops in
Cheapside.”</p>

<h3>MARTIN FINDS A WAY</h3>

<p class='pindent'>By the light of the lantern carried by the man with the
scar Martin had made a hasty survey of his prison. It
was a large, empty room, apparently part of a disused
warehouse. When the men went away they took the
lantern with them, leaving the place in complete
darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was at once aware of sounds of movement on
the floor above—sounds of heavy cases or bales being
dragged over the boards. At intervals also he heard
a creaking that suggested the lowering of goods over a
rusty pulley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where am I?” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sounds lulled, and his ears caught a slight
rustle in the room itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rats!” he said to himself. “I hope they won’t
attack me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the next pause in the louder sounds he heard
another rustle somewhat more prolonged, a faint
clanking, and he had the strange feeling that some
human being besides himself was in the room. Startled,
he called out quickly: “Who’s there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From some distant corner came a thin, piping voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me, Gundra.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gundra!” He felt surprise and relief; the Indian
boy was at least a friend. “Come and untie me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me no can,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me tied, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To thing in the wall. No can move it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your hands tied?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; a band round me, tight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin guessed that the boy, like himself, was
fastened to a staple, which was out of his reach. It
was clear that neither could get to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martin was not ready to admit that the situation
was hopeless. His hands, it is true, were tied, so
that he could not loose the knot at the staple, and he
knew that if he strained on the rope he would only
tighten the knot. It might be possible to jerk the staple
from the wall. He made several attempts, but finding
that there was no sound of tearing wood, no yielding of
the metal, he bent his mind to considering another way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was only a few feet of rope between him and
the staple. By a series of convulsive jerks he managed
to wriggle over the floor until he lay at the foot of the
wall. Supporting himself against it, he got on to his
knees, and was then able to touch the rope with his
mouth. He asked himself whether it would be easier
to cut through it with his teeth, or to rise to his feet,
trace the rope to the staple, and work away until he
had loosed the knot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he could make up his mind he heard heavy
footsteps outside, growing louder as they approached.
Instantly he dropped to the floor, wriggled back to his
former position, and, when the door opened, lay on his
elbow as though he were incapable of rising higher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through a door at the farther end of the room came
Sebastian, the fat cook of the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>. From one
hand swung a horn lantern; in the other he carried a
large platter holding a pitcher of water and a hunk of
bread. He crossed to the corner where Gundra lay,
gave him a kick, set the platter beside him, then
moved along to Martin, and leered down upon him,
pouring out a stream of abuse in his own language.
Having examined the staple and rope, he laughed
maliciously, banged Martin’s head with the lantern,
and left the room, locking the door behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had taken advantage of the lantern light
to make a careful mental note of the position of the
staple. As soon as the sound of Sebastian’s footsteps
had died away he wriggled again to the wall, rose upon
his knees, then upon his feet, and began to tug with his
teeth at the knot about the staple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time he toiled in vain, trying one part of
the knot after another. Despairingly he felt that his
teeth would yield before the hempen rope. But
presently he was aware of a slight loosening, and taking
heart, he continued to bite at the same coil. To his joy
the knot grew looser and looser; the second coil was
easier to undo than the first; now he felt the free
end of the rope slipping out, and in a few more minutes
it was clear of the staple and dropped on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His lips were sore, his jaw ached intolerably; and the
uneasy posture he had had to maintain had strained his
muscles to the point of extreme fatigue. For a while
he lay quietly resting, not even telling Gundra that he
was free. The noises still continued on the upper floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length he started to jerk and worm his way
across the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m coming to untie you,” he said in a low tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moving only inch by inch, with frequent pauses for
rest, he was a long time in reaching the Indian boy’s
corner. When at last he rolled beside him he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, your hands are free; untie the rope round
the sack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gundra groped with his fingers, and found the knot,
but it had been so well tied that it was some minutes
before he succeeded in loosening it. Then he pulled the
sack away, and made a shorter job of untying Martin’s
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now to release you,” said Martin; “but I must
wait until my hands are less cramped. What is this
place, Gundra?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A big godown by the river,” replied the boy.
“Plenty goods upstairs, belong for <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin suddenly remembered that on the evening
when he had rowed Blackbeard down the river his
passenger had directed him at first to row towards a
large warehouse on the bank, but had changed his
mind. No doubt this was the very warehouse which
had been chosen for the safe-keeping of the boys. It
was plain, too, that it had been used as a place of
storage for ill-gotten goods until the time came when
they might safely be transferred to the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only I can get out,” Martin thought, “I’ll be in
time to put a spoke in Blackbeard’s wheel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt over Gundra’s body to ascertain how he was
fastened. About his middle was a steel girdle, connected
by a fine chain with the staple in the wall.
Martin discovered in a few moments that it was impossible
to detach the chain at either end; the links,
though small, were of tough metal, and gave no sign
of yielding under the strongest strain he could put
upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is thirsty work,” said Martin. “I’ll take a
drink from your pitcher, Gundra. They haven’t
brought me any water or food; I suppose they think
they’ll tame me. They don’t starve you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; give food; not much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how long have you been here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gundra explained that in the dead of Saturday
night someone had come into the cupboard under the
stairs, gagged him, and carried him out of the house.
He had struggled hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That accounts for Mr. Seymour’s button,” thought
Martin. “But how am I to get Gundra free?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat for a while considering, with his knees up and
his chin on his hands. “I’ll try it,” he exclaimed at
length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The staple was driven deep into the wall, but
Martin’s idea was that its setting might be loosened by
picking at the wood around it, and that then a tug
would wrench it away. Opening his clasp knife he
began to scrape and chip at the wood, which being oak
offered a considerable resistance to his rather blunt
blade. More than once he pulled at the staple without
detecting any sign of its yielding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about a violent jerk?” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He explained to Gundra what he proposed to do.
They both stood close to the wall. Martin got his hands
firmly between Gundra’s body and the steel girdle;
then at the same moment both he and the Indian made
a sudden leap into the room. The staple was torn
from its setting; the boys fell in a heap on the floor,
and the metal rattled and clanged. Clasping each
other, they listened breathlessly. Had the sounds been
heard by the men above?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were no cries, no sudden movement, no footsteps.
Every now and then came the creaking of the
pulley-block which had been going on at intervals ever
since Martin had been brought into the room, and the
exchange of a few words between the men who were
presumably attending to the lowering of the goods.
They were too much occupied with their task to notice
the sounds in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now to get out!” said Martin in a whisper. “I
think I can find my way to the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me come; no let go,” said Gundra, clinging to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved together in the direction of the door.
The chain on the Indian boy’s girdle clanked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This won’t do,” said Martin. “Tuck it up inside
the belt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this was done they started again. Martin had
taken his bearings by the light of the fat cook’s
lantern, but in the pitch darkness he was at fault, and
it was only by feeling round the wall that they at last
reached the door. It was locked. There was no
escape that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any windows?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sahib. But another door; oh, yes, over there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have seen it open?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but see light in crack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we’ll make for that. Keep close to me.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH</h1></div>

<h3>THE BOYS ESCAPE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The two boys groped across the room to find the
second door. Suddenly Martin tripped and almost
fell; he had stepped into a hole where the floor-boards
were rotted away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take care, Gundra,” he said, recovering himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt on the floor to ascertain the size of the gap,
then led the Indian boy cautiously across it, and almost
immediately touched a wall. Passing his hand along it,
he came upon an iron bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think this is it,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feeling along the bar and the wall behind it, he discovered
a vertical crack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A folding door,” he thought. “Now to lift the bar
and see if we can open the door and find out where it
leads to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bar was thick and heavy, and so well settled
down into its sockets that it had evidently not been
used for some time. Martin’s efforts to lift it at first
had no success, but after much pulling and pushing
it shifted upward suddenly with a loud squeaking
noise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys held their breath, wondering whether the
sound had been heard in the room above. But the slow
creaking still went on, and Martin ventured to raise
the bar from its place and lay it gently on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an iron ring in one of the panels of the
double door. Inserting his finger in this Martin pulled,
and the panel, sticking at first, presently came inward
with a squeak; clearly its hinges needed oiling. Inch by
inch he drew it towards him. A strong breeze blew into
the room, carrying with it a salt tang. The clear sky
eastward was studded with stars, which kindled
reflections in the river. Nearer at hand a reddish glow
suffused the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While they were gazing out there was a creak above
them, much louder than they had heard before, and a
large object dangling at the end of a rope passed slowly
downward within a yard of their faces. It was plain
that goods were being let down from the store-room
above with some care to avoid noise, for there was no
shouting, no giving and receiving directions, no cries of
“Are you ready?” “Lower away!” such as were usual
in operations of the kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holding on by the door, Martin bent down and
peered over the edge, careful to keep out of sight. The
package that had been lowered rested on a sort of
quay between the wall of the warehouse and the shored-up
bank of the river. A man was disengaging it from
the rope. When it was free he shook the rope as a
signal that it might be drawn up, then hoisted the
package on to a truck and wheeled it along the quay
until he came to a short jetty. There he halted and
lowered it over the side; evidently a boat was moored
below. Apparently the tide was too low to allow of the
boat’s drawing in nearer to the bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile a second load came slowly down over the
pulley, and reached the ground with a slight jolt. The
man had not yet returned from the jetty with the
truck. Martin wondered whether it would be possible
to slide down the rope without attracting attention.
The stars gave very little light, and the glow from the
Fire was intercepted by the angle of the warehouse.
The distance from the door to the ground was less than
twenty feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaning out he cautiously tried the rope. It gave
under a slight pull, showing that the man above was
no longer holding it firmly. But he must have noticed
the movement, for Martin heard a hoarse voice
whisper, “Don’t pull the rope through the block, you
fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shrank back into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you there?” whispered the voice again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment the man below reached the package
on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” he growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said, don’t pull on the rope!” repeated the man
above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t touch it!” responded the other gruffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an inaudible reply from the upper storey.
The second load was discharged and trundled away,
the rope again wound up, and by the time the man
returned from the jetty a third package had been
lowered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Martin had arrived at a conclusion. If
he and Gundra were to escape by the rope, they must
cling to it while it was descending weighted with a
load, and while the man below was still absent at the
jetty. There was the risk of their being discovered
through the man at the pulley feeling the extra drag on
the rope, or through the return of the other man while
they were still suspended in the air. Even should they
reach the ground safely, there was the further risk of
their being intercepted, for they would have to pass
the jetty on their left, and go through the lower floor of
the warehouse, the quay on the right apparently ending
at a high blank wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was clear that they must either face these
risks, with a chance, however slight, of escaping, or
remain as prisoners in the room, with the certainty that
the breaking of their bonds would be discovered as
soon as fat Sebastian paid them his next visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In rapid whispers Martin explained his plan to the
Indian boy. Timid as Gundra had hitherto appeared,
it was plain that ill-usage had not utterly broken
his spirit, for he agreed eagerly to make the attempt,
and promised to follow Martin’s instructions faithfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go first,” said Martin, with the idea of giving
Gundra confidence. “We can’t both go down with the
same load. You must wait for the next, but don’t come
down till you see I am safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They waited, tingling with impatience and excitement,
until once more a heavy package came swaying
past the open door. As soon as it had descended below
the sill, Martin took a firm hold of the rope and swung
off. There was a louder creaking of the pulley above, a
more violent oscillation of the load, a sudden quickening
of the rate of descent; then the slow, even movement
was resumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin glanced up. The pulley block hung from the
wall above a similar door some twelve feet above. The
man who operated the machine was not visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin slid down until his feet touched the package.
The moment this reached the ground he slipped off and
glided along the wall until he came to a shaded corner
beyond the shore end of the jetty. There he drew back
as far as possible into the shadow and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you there?” he heard the man in the upper
room whisper huskily, and saw him lean over, holding
on to the rope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer. His mate was at that moment
half-way back from the jetty, pushing the truck before
him. A minute or so later, when he began to loose the
package, the man above noticed the movement of the
rope, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You there, Bob?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! What’s up? In a hurry, ain’t you? You’ve
got the easy job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No call to be nasty! Have a care to stand from
under when the loads are coming down. These old
blocks are sticking. There was a mighty bad jolt just
now. I don’t trust ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; be there much more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half a dozen boxes or so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sorry. The tide is making. I might as
well wait a few minutes, then I can pull the barge up a
bit and save all this hiking with the truck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s heart sank. If the man did as he suggested,
Gundra would have no opportunity of escaping. But
next moment he was reassured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tain’t safe,” said the man above. “Barge might
stick in the mud, and tide take an hour or more to lift
her. The sooner we get these things on board the
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the men were talking the rope had been drawn
up, and another load was fastened to it almost as soon
as the man below had started to wheel the previous one
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pulley creaked, the package descended. Martin
watched anxiously, wondering whether Gundra’s
nerve would fail, whether the addition of his weight to
the rope would cause the man this time to look over.
He saw the slight form issue from the doorway and
clutch the rope. Gundra was much lighter than
Martin; the extra weight made scarcely any difference
to the rate at which the rope descended. But Martin
did not feel secure until the load bumped on the ground,
and the Indian boy, running as lightly as a wild animal,
reached his side.</p>

<h3>MARTIN USES HIS WITS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Both the boys were panting a little, as much from
excitement as from exertion. For a few moments they
remained, silent and still, in the shadowy recess.
Martin’s thoughts were busy with the new problem,
how to make good their escape. They were free, but
they were not at large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we wait until the loading is finished?”
Martin asked himself. “There are only a few more
loads to come down, then the barge will put off. No
doubt these men will leave, too, and we shall be able to
get away at leisure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he pondered the matter he decided for immediate
action. Convinced that the goods now being
removed were stolen property, he was bent on saving it
if that were possible, and the only obvious means of
saving it was to inform someone in authority who
would send officers of the law to arrest both goods and
men. There was very little time. To win complete
freedom was a matter of urgency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along,” Martin whispered when the man was
once more busy at the jetty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crept along by the wall to the door of the
warehouse. It was shut and bolted. On each side of it
was a window, but the shutters were up, and heavily
barred. It would be impossible even to attempt to
force an entrance without making a noise that would
bring the man hot-foot upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin glanced this way and that. The quay on the
landward side was entirely enclosed. It seemed that
there was no exit from it except through the warehouse,
and that was shut. They were trapped after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was the river. Could they escape by that?
Was there, below the jetty, a wherry or any kind of
row-boat in addition to the barge that was being loaded?
Martin could not see one. Nor could they seize an
opportunity and dive into the river, for beneath the
shore end of the jetty there was nothing at low tide but
liquid mud, probably deep enough to engulf them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All at once the man’s remark about pulling the
barge up recurred to Martin. An idea struck him that
made his heart bound and his nerves tingle. He
whispered a few words to Gundra, and anyone who
could have observed them would have noticed how they
braced themselves up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of Martin’s inspiration showed itself when
the man next left the barge and wheeled the truck back
along the jetty and across the quay. As soon as his
back was turned, they quitted their hiding-place and,
stooping low, made a dash for the jetty, the sound of
their movements being drowned by the noise of the
rumbling wheels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the place where the jetty sprang from the quay
they stopped, lowered themselves over the side, and
slipped on to one of the cross-beams that supported
the planking. There they crouched breathlessly. It
was a perilous position, for the timber was slippery
with slime, and they had to hug it closely to prevent
their sliding off. There, clinging and crouching, they
remained until the man had again come and gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the man was at a safe distance, they
clambered up to the jetty, and crept along it on all
fours until they came just above the barge. This was
now well afloat, but it was moored stem and stern to
posts on the jetty, as they saw by the light of a small
oil-lamp standing on a tub amidships. Boxes were
piled fore and aft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two boys slid down on to the barge by the rope
by which the man had lowered the goods. Martin
ran to the stern and tried to cast the aft mooring rope
loose; but the knot was firm and the rope hard, and he
had not succeeded when he heard the rumbling of the
truck wheels along the quay. There was not time to
complete the job before the man arrived. The urgent
necessity at the moment was to hide and hope that he
would not see them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together they crouched down in the narrow space
between the piled boxes and the gunwale. With beating
hearts they heard the rumbling draw nearer; the
heavy tramp of the man; his mutterings as he heaved
his load from the truck and lowered it to the deck of
the barge. They held their breath. Would the man
follow it? No; he swung it almost over their heads,
and it settled with a bump a few feet short of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment the man retreated, Martin dashed back
to the aft rope, struggled with the knot until he
managed to cast it off, hastened forward and cast off
the rope there likewise. The barge swung free. Against
its gunwale lay the long heavy sweeps with which it was
propelled. Martin attempted to lift one of these, but
found it impossible to do so without Gundra’s help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The barge was already lurching shoreward on the
tide. In a few moments, unless its motion was checked,
it would strike the mud, and then all hope of escape
was lost. Holding the sweep between them, the boys
drove it against the beams that supported the jetty,
and tried to push off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unused to the handling of so clumsy an implement,
the boys were unable to prevent its end from glancing
off the slimy timber, and it plunged with a splash into
the water. But they had not let it go. Levering it up
across the gunwale, they once more made the attempt,
and by exerting all possible pressure were able to
force the barge a yard or two from the jetty. Then they
were almost undone by their own vigour, for the sweep
slipped again as the barge sheered away, and they fell
forward, striking against the gunwale, and dropping the
sweep with a loud clatter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They seized it just in time to save it from being
carried overboard. Meanwhile the barge had lost the
impetus they had given it, and was again drifting
shoreward. It was clear that the noise they had made
had been heard by the men. There was a shout and
hurried footsteps on the quay, and Martin, looking up,
could just see in the starlight the man at the upper
door leaning out and making wild movements with his
arms, evidently to urge on his mate below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment this man came in sight, running along
the quay to the spot where he expected the barge
to strike if it escaped the mud. Martin saw that the
next few minutes would decide his fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catch hold!” he cried to the Indian boy. “Shove
when I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed the sweep at the angle between two
supporting beams, and with Gundra’s help drove it
into the notch, and brought all his weight and strength
to bear upon it. The barge sidled outward, slowly, too
slowly. Martin realised that if the man had run on to
the jetty, he could have jumped on board before the
heavy vessel was out of range.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let go,” Martin called, as the sweep dropped
from its resting-place into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keeping a tight grasp on the pole, the boys pulled it
slowly through the water. The barge swung about a little,
and Martin saw with joy that the gap between it and
the quay was wider. It was now too late for the man to
attempt the leap. He stood on the quayside, shouting,
cursing, gesticulating to his companions, two men who
were running to join him. The second of them,
lumbering along in the rear, Martin recognised as
Sebastian the fat cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unwieldy though the sweep was, Martin was learning
under the stress of necessity how to manipulate it, his
knowledge of oarsmanship assisting. Laboriously he
and Gundra dragged it through the water, and at every
stroke the barge forged a little farther from the quay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men there were in all the agitation of helpless
rage. There was a flash, a crack; one of them had
fired a pistol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fool!” shouted one of his companions. “Do
you want to bring all Deptford down upon us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The answer was inaudible on the barge. There the
boys, panting and sweating from their exertions in the
hot night, did not relax their efforts until the heavy
vessel was clear of the jetty and had begun to drift
upstream on the tide. Then, as they paused, they
heard the same voice apparently giving an order,
though the words could not be distinguished. Dimly
they saw the three figures run along the quay, then they
were lost to sight in the darkness. A few moments
later there came the sound of rusty hinges creaking;
somewhere a gate was opening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they about now?” thought Martin;
and he noticed for the first time that Gundra’s eyes
were wide with amazement and fright as they gazed
upon the ruddy glow of the Fire.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE THIRTIETH</h1></div>

<h3>THE BOYS SWIM FOR IT</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Martin felt that he had been uncommonly lucky. The
utmost he had hoped for was to escape with Gundra
from the warehouse; it now seemed to his sanguine
spirit that he would save the stolen property as well.
The barge was slowly drifting upstream; there was no
present sign of pursuit; and if his luck held, before
long he would get assistance from friendly hands, and
the evil schemes of Blackbeard, Slocum, and the rest
would be brought to nought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had pitched his hopes too high. The heavy
barge moved only at the pace of the tide, and neither
Martin nor the Indian had sufficient muscular strength
to work the cumbersome sweep for more than a few
minutes at a time. And they were soon aware that the
pursuit had started. In the light from the glowing
sky they caught sight of three or four men hurrying
along the road that bordered the river. They were
outstripping the barge; it was probably their intention
to get well ahead, find a boat, and cut across the course
of the fugitives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They might be delayed by the fact that every
serviceable boat had been engaged for the conveyance
of householders’ goods, but sooner or later they would
get some kind of craft, and then the end was inevitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same dearth of boats operated against Martin.
He hailed one or two that passed, but the watermen
would not so much as wait to hear his explanations;
they were reaping a golden harvest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What could be done? The only chance seemed to be
to run the barge across the river to the north bank, as
near as possible to the stairs where Martin’s friends
were wont to ply, and trust to finding one or other of
them at hand and ready to help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The barge was drifting broadside with the stream,
and it was only by dint of great efforts and strenuous
pulling at the sweep that the boys were able to bring
her head in the desired direction. They had hardly
begun to creep towards the north bank when they
heard shouts ahead, and saw a wherry putting out
from the southern shore and making to cross their
bows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fiery aspect of the sky seemed to increase the
heat of the summer night, and Martin felt the sweat
pouring off him in streams as he tugged desperately at
the sweep. He realised in a few moments the impossibility
of gaining the stairs before the wherry overtook
him. To save the goods was beyond hoping for; it
would be as much as he could do to save himself and
Gundra from capture. They must abandon the barge
and swim for the shore, now perhaps some fifty yards
distant. Could they do so without being seen and
followed? Martin had little doubt that the pursuers
would strain every nerve to capture them, and so
ensure that the sailing of the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span> should not
be interfered with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must swim for it,” he said, dropping the sweep.
“Come with me, and keep low.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crept behind the pile of cargo that had
sheltered them when they first boarded the barge, and
slipped over the gunwale into the water on the side
remote from the pursuing wherry. Martin hoped to get
at least half way to the shore before he was seen. With
Gundra he struck out vigorously, but was soon conscious
that his strength had already been overtaxed,
and he would be unable to keep up his stroke for more
than a minute or two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed that they had only left the barge a few
seconds when they heard the wherry bump into its
side, and the men scrambling on board, cursing as they
searched for the fugitives. The search did not last
long; one of the pursuers caught sight of the swimmers,
who might perhaps have got away unseen but for the
glare of the Fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There they are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shout caused Martin and Gundra to put all their
remaining strength into their strokes. The pursuers
rushed for their boat, and it was fortunate for the
swimmers that it lay on the farther side of the barge.
By the time it had been pulled round the stern the
boys had entered shallow water, and were wading
ashore in the mud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the pursuers made a mistake. Had they
continued on their course upstream and rowed across
to the nearest stairs, or to one of the quays that broke
the riverside, they could have landed well ahead of the
boys and met them while they were still floundering in
the mud flats. But in their haste and flurry, due no
doubt to their wish to avoid drawing too much attention
from passing boats, they swung round against
the current and made toward the boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ankle deep in slime, Martin and Gundra struggled on
to gain the waste land that stretched up from the
river bank. The pursuing boat rapidly approached
them, and was only some twenty yards behind when its
nose stuck in the mud, throwing the rowers forward over
their oars. Cursing violently, the men strove to back
water, but the boat was held fast, the oars were useless,
and it was only after precious time had been
wasted that the men decided to jump overboard and
continue the pursuit on foot.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/img-155.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0006' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the clinging mud their weight told against them.
By the time they had dragged themselves on to the dry
land the boys were already disappearing into the
hedge-lined lane that wound north-westward in the
direction of Spitalfields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they ran the chain by which Gundra had been
fastened slipped from his steel girdle, and its clanking
gave a clue to their line of flight. They heard the heavy
feet of their pursuers thundering after them. Martin
tucked the chain up as well as he could, scarcely
changing his pace, and dragged Gundra along. In a
minute or two they would reach houses, and among
them, shadowed from the glare of the Fire, they
might hope to elude further pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No can run,” panted Gundra suddenly, placing his
hand over his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A stitch,” thought Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To lose time would be fatal. Without a moment’s
hesitation he hauled the Indian through a thin place in
the hedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lie flat,” he whispered. “Don’t make a sound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They lay beneath the hedge, trying to smother the
sounds of their quick breathing. The pursuers came
up, passed; their footsteps receded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better wait and see if they come back,” thought
Martin. “We are both dog-tired, and want a rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minutes passed. Martin listened for the sound of
returning footsteps. Presently he heard them, slow,
dragging. The men went by on the other side of the
hedge; there was sullen rage in the tone of their voices.
Martin waited until he could hear them no longer; then
he turned to the Indian boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can go now,” he said. “The pain is gone,
Gundra?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gundra was asleep.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIRST</h1></div>

<h3>GOLLOP MAKES A DISCOVERY</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The little fellow screamed when Martin roused him,
and started up in a fright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! It’s all right,” said Martin. “The men have
gone. We must get home and tell Gollop all about it.
He will tell us what is best to be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reflected that if, as he supposed, the barge held
stolen goods that were to form part of the cargo of the
<span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>, it would take some time to row that
clumsy craft against the tide, and it might still be
possible to intervene before the vessel sailed. No doubt
she would leave her moorings as soon as the tide
turned, and make what headway she could against the
east wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had no idea what hour of the night it was,
and he was surprised, before they had gone far on the
homeward way, to notice signs of dawn in the sky.
When they reached the house the sun was peering
above the horizon, its beams competing with the glow
of the Fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Descending into the basement, Martin found the old
Frenchman in anxious consultation with the Gollops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s Martin!” cried Lucy gleefully. “Oh, I <span class='it'>am</span>
glad you’ve come home. We’ve been in such a state
about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a wink of sleep for any of us all night,” said
Susan. “Why, bless me! Here’s the blackamoor too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gundra had crept in timidly behind the elder boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now what have you to say for yourself?” the
woman went on. “As if there weren’t worries enough
without——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace, woman!” cried the constable. “Don’t rate
the lad. He’s fair foundered, by the look of him. Sit
you down, Martin, and tell us what has kept you out
all night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was glad enough to rest, and Lucy had
already taken possession of Gundra, placed him in a
corner of the settle, and was asking eager questions
about the strange girdle he wore about his body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without wasting words Martin related how he had
followed Mr. Slocum’s handcart, been trapped in the
yard, and finally carried off to the disused warehouse;
how he had escaped with Gundra, and got away on the
barge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a chip of the old block,” said Gollop
delightedly; “and your poor father would be proud of
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Slocum’s a wretch,” said Susan. “I always
said so. Now, what are you going to do, Gollop?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do! What can I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a man for you! Just as bad as the Lord
Mayor. What can you do, indeed! Why, just set off
after that barge this very minute and stop it before it’s
too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spoken like a woman,” responded Gollop. “You
don’t understand the law, Sue. Before that barge can
be stopped there must be a warrant drawn up proper,
saying as how Richard Gollop, constable——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddle-diddle!” Susan broke in scornfully. “Go out
and get your warrant, then, instead of talking about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d get never a magistrate to listen to me; they
can’t think of nothing but the Fire. But I’ll tell you
what I will do: I’ll go down to the river and see this
vessel, <span class='it'>Santa</span> something or other; there’s plenty of
time, for they’ve got to unload the barge. I’ll ask a
question or two along the riverside, and if what I hear
bears out the lad’s tale——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! Get along with you,” cried his wife. “It’s
a mercy the world isn’t all made of men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you can’t help, make the best of,” said
Gollop, as he hurried away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan quickly prepared a meal for the famished
boys. While she did so she continued the conversation
with Mounseer which Martin’s entrance had interrupted.
It appeared that the Frenchman was becoming
anxious about the safety of the house. On returning
home about midnight the constable had reported
that there were signs of the Fire’s working back against
the wind. Already several houses eastward of Pudding
Lane had been consumed by the flames, and although
the danger was as yet not imminent, there was a risk
that if the wind lulled or changed, the area of destruction
would extend to the Tower and the adjacent
streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your mind easy, Mounseer,” said Susan with
comfortable assurance. “The neighbours will give us
good warning if so be the Fire comes nigh, and you’ll
have time to collect your belongings; not that you’ve
got much to lose, so far as I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin caught a strange look on the Frenchman’s
face as he left the room to return to his own apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you’ve eat your fill, Martin,” said Susan,
“you’d better go to sleep. The blackamoor child has
dropped off already, poor lamb!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin lay down on his bed, but he found it impossible
to sleep. His brain whirled with thoughts of
the Fire, and the barge, and the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>; of
Slocum, and Blackbeard, and the rest; and in spite of
Susan’s confidence the mere suggestion that the Fire
might spread to their own house and swallow it up
filled him with alarm. He could not bear to think that
the Gollops might presently be among the thousands of
families that had lost their all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he could not endure inaction any longer.
He sprang up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going out,” he said. “I must see for myself
where the Fire has got to. I won’t be very long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the top of the stairs he banged into Gollop, red-faced
and panting through haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my eyes! Here’s a wonder!” gasped the
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it? Has the Fire got to us?” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Fire! What’s the Fire to you? Martin, my lad,
never did I think I’d live to see this day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me—what is it?” asked Martin in wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, call me a Dutchman if that there Portugal
ship ain’t the <span class='it'>Merry Maid</span>, your father’s own vessel
what never came home, to his ruin, poor old captain of
mine. The moment I set eyes on her I rubbed ’em,
’cos I couldn’t believe it. But I knowed them lines; I
knowed the pretty creature, though they’d done something
to alter the look of her. She’s the captain’s ship
as sure as I’m alive. And now you must come with
me; we’ll go to the Lord Mayor or somebody and get a
warrant. She’s ready to slip her moorings; we must
arrest her; what’s your father’s is yours; that’s the
law, and soon they’ll know it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Waiting just long enough to tell his wife of his amazing
discovery, the constable hurried away with Martin
in his quest of the Lord Mayor. But that magnate was
not to be found; nor were any of the sheriffs discovered
in the devastated city. Gollop, distracted, was beating
his wits to recall the name and address of some
magistrate in a district still untouched when Martin
suddenly caught sight of Mr. Pemberton, the customer
of Slocum’s whom he had met on two occasions. The
gentleman was standing among a group of his friends,
to whom he was pointing out the site of his own
ruined dwelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must be a magistrate,” thought Martin,
remembering how Mr. Pemberton had interfered
when the crowd was molesting the Frenchman. “I’ll
ask him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ran up to the group, pushed his way among them
without much ceremony, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, may I speak to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pemberton stared at the eager boy, displeased at
what appeared to be an unmannerly intrusion. Then
his brow cleared; he smiled and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend the fighter, isn’t it? Well, what have
you been fighting about now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin coloured as he felt the eyes of the group
focussed on him. But he recovered his composure in a
moment, and began to pour out his story. At first the
gentlemen listened with smiles of amusement or toleration,
but as he proceeded their interest was awakened,
and Mr. Pemberton himself watched him with keen
attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay,” he said at one point. “Your father was
Reuben Leake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, that was his name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard of him; a sound mariner. Go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin continued his story, doing his best to make
its complications clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now let me understand,” said Mr. Pemberton
when he had finished. “This vessel, the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>,
once the <span class='it'>Merry Maid</span>, is on the point of sailing with a
cargo which you suspect to consist of stolen goods,
some of them the property of the respected goldsmith
Mr. Greatorex. You say that Mr. Slocum, Mr. Greatorex’s
man, is concerned in this crime with the captain
of the vessel, whom you call Blackbeard, and a man
named Seymour. The crew is mainly foreign; they
have held an Indian boy as a slave, and they kidnapped
him when you had rescued him from them,
and shut you up with him in a warehouse at Deptford.
Have I the story right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir; all that is true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let me say—and my friends will agree with
me—that you have shown uncommon intelligence and
courage and resource. Your running off with the barge
was an admirable device and deserved to succeed. And
now I understand that you wish to have a warrant for
the arrest of the vessel before she leaves the river.
But you must have someone in authority to execute
the warrant, and in the present state of the city——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s me, your worship,” broke in Gollop, who
had stood at hand. “Being a man of law in the shape
of a constable——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Well, we must lose no time. But I have no
paper, no pen—— Stay, is that a half-burnt ledger I
see among the ashes there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin leapt to the spot and picked up the book.
Mr. Pemberton tore out a page, hurriedly wrote a few
lines upon it with a pencil, and handed it to the
constable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, my man,” he said, “that is the best I can
do for you. I cannot swear that the phraseology is
absolutely in form, but it will serve. I don’t know
what you will do if your Blackbeard shows fight. There
is no available force to put at your disposal; you must
do the best you can. I wish you success. I shall be
glad to learn the issue of this strange affair.”</p>

<h3>THE PURSUIT</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Martin sat on a thwart side by side with Hopton,
listening intently to the discussion that passed between
Gollop and Boulter as they pulled the boat steadily
downstream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She got away with the first of the ebb,” said the
constable. “What’s the odds on our catching her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That depends,” replied the waterman cautiously.
“I reckon she’s got three or four hours’ start, but she
won’t go faster than the tide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so fast, against this wind,” said Gollop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, but it ain’t blowing so hard, and it’s my
belief it’ll drop to a calm afore night. Well then, she’ll
hardly make Gravesend afore the turn of tide, and as
she can’t beat up against the wind in the narrow
reaches she’ll have to lay up when the ebb fails. For
summat about three hours we ought to gain a bit on
her, but not so much as to overhaul her, and then we’ll
have the tide against us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And be dead beat; I ain’t so handy with an oar as
I was in my sea-going days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve a friend or two in Woolwich, and if so be
they ain’t saving the London folk’s goods I’ll get ’em
to come aboard and take a spell while we rest. But
suppose we catch the Portugal ship, what then,
Gollop?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I’ve got a warrant, ain’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much good that’ll be,” said Boulter scornfully.
“They won’t care a fig for warrants or anything but
swords and firelocks. You ought to have took a boatload
of soldiers, that’s what I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, it’s easy to say, but it couldn’t be done. Well,
what you can’t help, make the best of. I tell you this:
that Portugal ship, leastways the <span class='it'>Merry Maid</span>, shan’t
get out of the river if I can help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was half-inclined to regard the pursuit as a
wild-goose chase, and Hopton had nothing to say to
encourage him; but uncertainty gave a spice to the
adventure, and they felt a pleasant thrill of anticipation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time they reached Woolwich the tide had
turned, and Boulter thought it well to pull to the
shore, partly for rest and food, partly to seek out his
friends, enquire of them whether they had noticed the
Portugal ship, and try to enlist their help. Luckily he
came upon two watermen whom he knew well, and
who were disengaged. From them he learnt that the
vessel had passed about three hours before; she had
tow boats out, towing her, and it was a matter of
speculation on the riverside why her crew were
putting themselves to so much exertion in such hot
weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gollop’s face fell when he heard this news. It was
clear that Blackbeard expected pursuit, and was
making all possible speed to evade it. Boulter’s
friends agreed to join the expedition, under promise of
a good reward if it proved successful, and the boat set
off again after half an hour’s delay, the fresh oarsmen
making good progress even against the tide. When all
four men were pulling its pace was noticeably rapid,
and at Erith, six miles beyond Woolwich, Gollop was
delighted to learn on enquiry from an upgoing barge
that the <span class='it'>Merry Maid</span> was now little more than two
hours ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hour after hour the rowers plied their oars, taking
turns to rest in couples. Martin and the old Frenchman,
who had been up all night, fell asleep on their seats, and
when they awoke it was five o’clock in the afternoon,
and the boat was approaching Gravesend. Here
Gollop decided to go ashore, for as the day wore on he
had become less confident, and recognised that if
Blackbeard and his crew resisted the arrest of the
ship the pursuers, hopelessly outnumbered, would not
be able to enforce it unless they could engage a party
adequately armed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both he and Boulter had acquaintances among the
mariners of Gravesend, but some of these were absent
from their usual haunts, having been drawn to London
by the prospect of making money out of the Fire. Those
who remained showed themselves distrustful and
suspicious; they were not to be tempted to lend their
services in a cause that might fail; and Gollop,
angry and troubled, made his way to the office of
the Customs officer of the port, and sought his aid as
a brother man of the law. The officer appeared to
resent this claim of relationship, and treated the
constable very off-handedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see this warrant you talk of,” he said, and
when Gollop produced the scrap of paper, creased,
oddly-shaped, its edges frayed and scorched, he sniffed.
“I cannot act on this,” he said. “It is not drawn up
in proper form. The <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span> has cleared; she
is bound for Lisbon, the port of an ally; she is beyond
my jurisdiction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this Gollop lost his temper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and your long words!” he said. “That there
vessel ain’t a Portugal ship; she’s English from stem to
stern; don’t I know? You’re neglecting of your duty,
master officer, and I’ll take good care that them above
you hear about it and you’ll get a rough hauling, my
fine fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get out of this,” cried the officer, losing his temper
in turn. “You may be a constable; I don’t know; but
you’ll find your legs in the stocks if you air your
insolence on an officer of His Majesty’s Customs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come away, Dick,” said Boulter soothingly. “We
ain’t done yet. And we can’t afford to lose any more
time. If the craft weathers Hope Point she’ll have a
clear run out and give us the slip altogether. Come on,
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within a few minutes the boat was again under way.
It was heavy work pulling her down Gravesend
Reach, and heavier still when, in Lower Hope Reach,
she came full in the teeth of the wind. An exclamation
from Martin caused Gollop to fling a hasty look over
his shoulder. Strung out along the lee shore three ships
lay at anchor, evidently waiting for the tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easy all!” cried Gollop, shipping his oar. A look of
triumph gleamed in his eyes. “The second o’ them
vessels—she’s the <span class='it'>Merry Maid</span>, bless her heart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure?” said Boulter. “She’s three-quarters
of a mile away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure! Am I sure I’ve a nose on my face? That
there’s my dear old captain’s craft, one in a thousand.
She’s safe for a few hours. We’ll go ashore and wet our
whistles, my mates; this is a chance we’ve got to make
the best of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They pulled in towards the shore, but lay a few yards
off the mud flats to talk over the next step before they
landed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t fight ’em, that’s certain,” said Boulter,
“being only seven all told, two of us just boys, and one
a aged furriner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mounseer smiled, and fingered his rapier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True for you, mate,” said Gollop. “Well, if you
ain’t strong enough to fight, what do you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speaking for myself, I plays a trick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spoke like a wise man. Now what trick could you
play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That depends,” said Boulter, scratching his head.
“What about boring a hole in her hull?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seeing as none of us is a sword-fish, that can’t be
done without ’tis noticed. What about giving ’em a
scare? Them furriners are easy frightened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t scare ’em into quitting the vessel.
But you talk of furriners. Now I come to think of it,
I’ve knowed furren gentlemen put aboard outgoing
vessels in the river—gentlemen as want to get away
secret, and pay well for it. If so be——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused and looked at the Frenchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If so be as our furren gentleman could go aboard
as a passenger, maybe the rest of us could get aboard
too, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that’s the trick, d’you see? What I say
is——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But perhaps Mr. Seymour’s aboard, and he knows
Mounseer,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better,” cried Gollop, slapping his
thigh. “But what does Mounseer say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do anything what please you,” said the Frenchman
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five minutes’ close discussion ensued. Then the
boat’s head was turned upstream, and the little party,
hopeful and elated, was speeding back to Gravesend.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE THIRTY-THIRD</h1></div>

<h3>AT GRIPS AT LAST</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In Gravesend they spent a busy hour. While Boulter
bought a small sea-chest at a marine store, Gollop
purchased cutlasses for the watermen and a stout staff
for Martin: Hopton fortunately had brought his club.
A visit to a slop shop provided sea-jackets and hats
for the two boys, and so disguised they might have
been taken for cabin boys ashore. The cutlasses,
wrapped in sacking, were laid in the chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d better wait for the dusk,” said Gollop. “How
about the tide, Boulter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twill turn at dusk or thereabouts,” replied the
waterman. “But the wind’s dropping, so we mustn’t
bide too long or the barque will slip us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True; but we’ll have time to fill our holds, which I
mean to say our stomachs. An empty man’s only half
a man, and every one of us will have to make two to-night,
or I’m a Dutchman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repairing to the Three Tuns inn, the little party
made a good meal; then they returned to the wherry
and set off on their adventure. The tide was still
running up, but the force of the wind had sensibly
diminished, and they made good progress toward their
destination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was setting behind them, and a slight haze
crept over the river. Presently the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span> hove
in sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All’s quiet on deck,” said Gollop, looking eagerly
ahead. “They feel pretty snug: so much the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The approach of the wherry was apparently not
noticed on board. It had drawn under the vessel’s
quarter before Boulter raised a hail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Santa Maria</span> ahoy!” he called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dark face showed itself above the gunwale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain aboard?” said Boulter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want a word with him,” the waterman continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer: the man simply stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speakee capitano,” said Boulter, as if obligingly
suiting his language to the comprehension of a foreigner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few halting words of broken English the man
declared that the captain was at supper and must not
be disturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you want?” he concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never you mind,” said Boulter. “Bring capitano:
maybe he’ll understand plain English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some further colloquy the man was prevailed
upon to seek the captain, and Martin felt a cold trickle
along his spine when he saw in the fading light the face
of Blackbeard looking down from the poop. Instinctively
he shrank down on his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you want?” demanded the captain, with his
foreign accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A gentleman wishes a passage in your vessel,
captain,” said Boulter, persuasively. “He must get
aboard at once: a foreign gentleman, you understand:
can pay well: fifty pounds, say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is impossible,” said Blackbeard bluntly. “There
is not cabin room for passenger. No; impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another face was peering over his shoulder, and
Martin effaced himself more thoroughly as he recognised
Slocum. The goldsmith threw a searching
glance over the boat. Martin saw him start, pluck
Blackbeard by the sleeve, and draw him out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he see me?” thought Martin, quaking a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a minute he was reassured. Blackbeard returned
alone, and Martin noticed that his eyes at once
sought Mounseer, who was sitting on a thwart next to
Gollop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have considered,” he said. “Perhaps for one.
You said one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes: one gentleman: a Frenchman,” said Boulter.
“London is not safe for the French. He was beset in
the street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well; he shall come. And quick: soon will the
tide turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He called up a seaman, and bade him lower a rope-ladder
from the waist. Mounseer got up, and staggered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is old and weak,” said Boulter. “Some of you
help him, there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the plan previously arranged, Martin
and Gollop each took one of the Frenchman’s arms and
led him to the ladder. Martin climbed nimbly to the
deck, then turned to assist Mounseer, who ascended
slowly, Gollop following. To all appearances the
Frenchman was feeble, exhausted; he tottered and
swayed between the others when all three were on
board. Meanwhile Boulter’s two watermen friends
were proceeding to carry up the sea-chest, which might
be supposed to contain the passenger’s baggage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come with me,” said Blackbeard. “We will make
bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the way towards the round-house, a sort of
cabin on the upper deck. Martin and Gollop led
Mounseer between them. Slocum had disappeared;
the only persons visible were Blackbeard, the dark-faced
seaman, and some members of the crew who were
lying outstretched on the planks, resting, no doubt,
after their exertions in towing the vessel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin looked curiously about the round-house as he
entered. It contained a well-spread table, two chairs
and two berths; the walls were lined with racks containing
arms of all kinds: firelocks, picks, swords, pistols.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a gesture from Blackbeard the Frenchman sank
into one of the chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you go,” the captain commanded, turning to
Martin and Gollop. “I will finish the bargain with this
gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Begging your pardon, sir,” said Gollop quietly,
“but afore I go it is in a manner of speaking——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you mean?” said Blackbeard, truculently.
“I say you go: there is no more for you: you have
done; the business is with this gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is, to be sure,” returned Gollop unperturbed.
“Leastways a part of it. But afore I go, it is in a
manner of speaking my duty as an officer of the law to
show you a dokyment——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had drawn from his pocket the warrant signed by
Mr. Pemberton and was proceeding to unfold it. But
something in his manner had aroused suspicion in
the captain, who made a quick sidelong movement and
snatched at a pistol in the nearest rack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Frenchman, who had appeared so weak
and faint, showed a marvellous alacrity for a man of
his years and impotence. He sprang up from his chair,
whipped out his rapier from under his cloak, and had
its point within an inch of Blackbeard’s throat while
his hand was still closing over the pistol butt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a second or two there was silence as the men
faced each other. Martin, quivering with excitement,
took in the details of the scene: Gollop flourishing the
paper in his hand; Blackbeard, his hand outstretched,
his nostrils dilating, his eyes glaring; Mounseer cool,
smiling, watching the other as a cat watches a mouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the silence was broken. The Frenchman,
wearing his inscrutable smile, said gently, in a tone
not above the conversational pitch:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur recognises—is it not so?—that he must
render himself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackbeard made no answer in words, but his eyes
narrowed, his fingers tightened on the pistol, and he
made an almost imperceptible movement. The
Frenchman read the intention in his eyes. The smile
disappeared, giving place to a look of grim resolution.
One twist of the wrist, and the rapier point, an instant
before at the man’s throat, flickered like a flash of
lightning and pricked him in the forearm. He winced;
the pistol fell clattering to the floor; and he let out a
cry, a loud wild cry that must have rung through the
ship from stem to stern: a rallying cry to his crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next instant a door at the farther end of the round-house,
which had stood ajar, was flung open, and a
water-bottle hurtled across the room. It missed the
Frenchman’s head by an inch, and crashed against the
wall. Through the door rushed two men, one behind
the other. In the foremost Martin recognised Mr.
Seymour, the tenant of the upper floor whose dealings
with Blackbeard had first awakened his suspicions. It
was he who had thrown the bottle; the second man
was for the moment hidden from view behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between the table and the wall on either side there
was only a narrow gangway, partly obstructed by the
chairs. As he dashed forward, Seymour snatched at a
cutlass hanging above the rack of arms. He grasped it,
but by the blade, for the hilt was higher than his head.
To make effective play with it he must needs lift it
from its nail and reverse it: even then the narrow
gangway would allow him no room to swing it, nor the
low roof space in which to bring it above his head: he
could only give point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before he could reverse the weapon and grasp
the hilt Gollop had found himself. Dropping his warrant,
he flung himself forward with a leonine roar.
Recalling the fight afterwards Martin wondered how
the burly constable had managed to squeeze himself
between the table and the wall to meet the attack.
The chair went clattering along the floor; a blow
from Gollop’s sledge-hammer fist, with sixteen stone
of brawn behind it, caught Seymour clean between the
eyes and sent him hurtling over the broken chair upon
the man behind. He dropped; his companion staggered,
recovered himself, and, shouting a furious curse, sprang
forward cutlass in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Protected in some degree by the huddled form of
Seymour, he made a desperate lunge at Gollop, who had
been carried forward by his own momentum, and
could now neither advance nor retreat. At this critical
moment Martin seized the second chair, and, gathering
his strength, hurled it at Slocum. It took him at the
level of his belt and doubled him up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then from without came a medley of shouts and the
rustling thud of bare feet upon the boards.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FOURTH</h1></div>

<h3>GOLLOP AT BAY</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The light of battle gleamed in Gollop’s eyes. He was
no longer the constable, whose weapons were a staff
and a rattle, but the boatswain of old, who had borne
his part in many a fight with pirates in the days when
he sailed the far seas with Captain Leake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I carries more flesh now than I did then,” he said
afterwards, when telling the story to his cronies.
“That’s what comes of marrying a good wife what
looks after your vittles. Still, what you can’t help,
make the best of; that’s what I always say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bulky though he was, at this critical moment he
showed himself astonishingly agile. He snatched two
cutlasses from the stand of arms, and thrust one into
Martin’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better than a stick, my lad,” he said. “Stand you
guard over they two rascals”—he indicated Slocum
and Seymour, who were sitting more or less disabled on
the floor. “If they stir, touch ’em with the point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, rather breathlessly, he turned to meet the
rush at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the Frenchman was keeping an eye on
Blackbeard. Disarmed and injured, the captain of the
<span class='it'>Santa Maria</span> stood between the table and the wall, his
dark face distorted with fury. Mounseer could not
attack him again while he was unarmed, nor was there
space or time for the duel that would have rejoiced the
Frenchman’s heart. But he knew that if he took his
eye off him for a moment he might expect a rush,
and all that he could do was to shift his ground
slightly so that he might be able to lend aid to Gollop
if the crew made a determined assault through the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will have the goodness to retire yourself one
step or two,” he said to Blackbeard, his tone icily
polite. To give himself room it was necessary that the
captain should move backward into the round-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackbeard muttered a curse under his breath, but
refused to budge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh bien, voilà!” said the Frenchman, with a
sudden deft movement pricking him with the point of
his rapier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain winced, shrieked out an oath, but made
no more ado about obeying orders. Then Mounseer
half turned, and stood so that he could either check
Blackbeard if he showed fight, or move to Gollop’s help,
as the occasion might demand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cutlass in hand, Martin stood over his prisoners,
who had shown no sign of activity themselves, but
were looking eagerly, hopefully, towards the door.
Martin found it difficult to prevent his attention from
being distracted by the fight that was now raging there.
The crew of the vessel, headed by the officer whom
Martin had seen once before, had surged in a yelling
crowd towards the round-house, catching up as they
ran any object that would serve as a weapon. Some had
marline-spikes, one brandished a short spar, another a
hanger; several had drawn evil-looking knives, and
fat Sebastian wielded a meat chopper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no order or discipline among them.
Shouting, gesticulating, they got in one another’s way
in their struggle to reach the door, where Gollop coolly
awaited their onset. His broad form blocked up the
narrow entrance; the foreigners could attack only
one at a time; and as they came on, one by one, each
was put out of action by a sudden thrust or cut or
lunge of the cutlass wielded by a master hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin glowed with admiration as he watched the
swift movements of the big man. Planted firmly on his
feet, his body scarcely swayed; but his sword-arm
swept from side to side, and the furious yells of his
opponents bespoke their sense of failure. Baffled,
they fell back; they collected in a group to devise some
plan whereby they might overcome this doughty
defender of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly there was a shout behind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahoy! ahoy! Firk ’em! At ’em, my hearties!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The startled group turned; there were a few moments
of wild confusion. Martin, looking under Gollop’s arm,
saw a welter of men, some bowled over like ninepins,
others crawling away on hands and knees. The
watermen, with George Hopton, taking their cue from
the noises on deck, had swarmed up from the wherry
and swept upon the foreigners from the rear. They burst
through, irresistible; the crew scattered to right and
left; and then Gollop issued forth from the doorway
and joined his friends with a roar of welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Round ’em up! Round ’em up!” he cried, and
striding ahead of his little party he chased the crew
around the deck, across the waist, down the ladders,
into every corner where they sought refuge. Bereft of
their leaders they had no heart to fight. Within a very
few minutes the foreigners had surrendered, and were
herded into the forecastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes more, and the prisoners in the round-house
were sitting in a disconsolate line against the
wall, their hands and feet securely tied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very pretty job,” said Gollop, looking approvingly
at the watermen’s work. “I reckon they
knots be firm enough, Mounseer; still, ’tis as well to
make sure; so maybe you’ll stand over ’em with that
steel of yours while we go and see what’s in them brass-bound
boxes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman smiled, and held his rapier at the
salute.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIFTH</h1></div>

<h3>MARTIN TO THE RESCUE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Gollop was in a quandary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had got possession of the <span class='it'>Santa Maria</span>, which
would henceforth be called by her old name, the
<span class='it'>Merry Maid</span>: what was he to do with her? Night had
fallen; the tide was running out again to the sea; it
seemed necessary to wait for morning light and the
turn of the tide before the vessel could be floated back
to London. But the constable had left his duty without
leave from his commanding officer, and though he had
Mr. Pemberton’s warrant to produce in self-justification,
he felt that if a strict judgment were passed upon
his action, he was in danger of losing his livelihood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me I’d better leave you in command, lad,”
he said to Martin, “the ship being yours, and row back
to the city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you are tired,” replied Martin; “it would be a
terribly hard pull against the tide, and we can’t spare
anyone to go with you; we’re very few to hold the ship
if the crew break out of the forecastle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, there’s them boxes,” Boulter put in. The
boxes had been opened and examined: they were full
of plate and jewellery. “I reckon they’re worth a good
few thousands of pounds, and Mr. Greatorex is so
much beholden to you that he’ll see you don’t lose by
the night’s work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe; gratitude ain’t a partickler common
virtue. Howsomever, what you can’t help, make the
best of. I’ll bide here till morning, and then we’ll see.
Martin, my lad, you’re dead beat; you’ve got old eyes;
turn in, you and your friend, and sleep sound till I
wake you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was glad enough to stretch himself on the
deck against the bulwark; his recent experiences had
worn him out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Gollop’s a Trojan,” said Hopton as he threw
himself beside him. “I say, I’ll go with you to Tyburn
to see Slocum hanged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose he <span class='it'>will</span> be hanged?” said Martin sleepily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certain sure. It will be a great show. I expect he’ll
make a fine speech on the gallows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martin was already asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he awoke in the early morning he found that
Gollop, in consultation with the watermen, had planned
out his course of action. The vessel would be left
in charge of the Customs officers, who would put a crew
on board, and lodge the criminals, Slocum, Blackbeard,
and Seymour, in jail; then the boarding party would
return to the City, Gollop would report to his captain,
and a posse of constables would no doubt be dispatched
to convey the criminals to London for trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About half-past five Boulter’s wherry set off on
its return journey to London. The party were well
satisfied with the result of their expedition, but the
pleasure of some of them was alloyed with anxiety.
During the night the wind had fallen away; the air was
still; and Gollop, equally with the Frenchman, was
filled with foreboding as to the progress the Fire might
have made during the twelve hours of his absence.
Already, before his departure, the flames had worked
back against the wind in the direction of the Tower,
and now that there was not even the wind to check
them, he was on tenterhooks lest they might have
gained his house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mounseer, so calm and self-possessed during the
scene in the round-house of the <span class='it'>Merry Maid</span>, was now
a prey to nervous agitation, which increased minute by
minute as the wherry neared its destination. He said
nothing, but the twitching of his eyelids and the restless
movements of his hands were clear signs of his
perturbation of spirit. Martin wondered, for, like
Susan Gollop, he had seen nothing of value in the old
gentleman’s apartment, and such possessions as he had
could be removed in a few minutes if the house were
attacked by the Fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The watermen pulled in to the steps where Martin
had first become suspicious of Slocum. There the party
separated: Gollop to seek his captain, Hopton to
return home, the watermen to resume their vocation;
Martin and the Frenchman to regain their dwelling-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If so be the house has caught, lad,” said Gollop at
parting, “I trust to you to look after my Sue and the
little one. I’ll come home the very first minute I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s misgivings increased as he hurried with
Mounseer through the streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure that’s Clothworkers Hall in Mincing Lane,”
he said, noticing a huge body of yellow flame rising
high into the air some distance to the left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped a man who was hurrying past, and asked
him how far the Fire had got.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far? Where have you been, then?” was the
reply. “Paul’s Church is in ashes; so’s Fleet Street
and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean on this side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the Custom House by the river has gone, so’s
a part of Tower Street, and Mincing Lane, and the
parsonage of Barking Church——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Juste ciel!” cried the Frenchman. “Our house is
near of that. Haste! haste!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mental distress, following on the fatigues of the
night, rendered the old gentleman’s steps unsteady,
and he clung to Martin’s arm for support. They hurried
on, their alarm growing from moment to moment.
Every now and then they heard a terrific explosion,
and saw immense columns of smoke, dust, and fragments
of wood spring into the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” asked Martin of a passer-by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blowing up houses in Seething Lane,” the man
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mon Dieu! How close!” muttered the Frenchman.
“For me it is ruin, ruin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last they turned the corner from which their
house could be seen. One glance was enough. Flames
were bursting from the roof. It appeared that the
house had caught fire at the top from floating sparks.
People were running hither and thither in the street,
carrying away their goods from the neighbouring
houses. In the roadway before the house was a little
group of three—Susan Gollop, Lucy, and the Indian
boy, standing guard over the household gear piled in
the roadway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan’s set face relaxed as she saw Martin running
towards her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Gollop? Where’s my man?” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s quite safe; he’ll be here soon,” Martin replied.
“Have you got everything out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything but the copper. We couldn’t lift that.
Come back, Mounseer; we’ve got your things too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman had withdrawn his arm from
Martin’s and was hurrying into the open doorway of
the house. He paid no attention to Susan’s cry, but
disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well I declare!’ cried Susan. “Did you ever know
such a foolish old gentleman! Because he’s French,
I suppose. Me and the blackamoor brought out all
his bits of things with our own hands: here they are.
But I suppose he wants to make sure we’ve got ’em
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go and bring him back,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no; bide here. He’ll see the room’s empty and
come back himself in a twink. There’s no call for you
to go into the smother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin allowed himself to be restrained. A knot of
spectators had gathered, and stared up at the burning
house. The flames were spreading from the roof downwards.
Smoke was pouring out of the windows.
Susan watched grimly; Lucy, her eyes wide with awe,
clung convulsively to Gundra, who seemed the least
concerned of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minute after minute passed. There was no sign of
the Frenchman. The window of his room was closed,
but smoke was trickling out at the edges of the casement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! where is my dear Mounseer?” cried Lucy,
tearfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drat the man!” said Susan. “What in the world
he’s doing I don’t know. He must have a bee in his
bonnet. Here now—Martin—come back! Come back,
I say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martin, unable to bear the suspense any longer,
had broken away and dashed into the burning house
to find his old friend.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SIXTH</h1></div>

<h3>MARTIN’S ORDEAL</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was only partly conscious of what he passed
through during the next minute, and not at all aware
of the risks he ran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old timber house had ignited from the top; the
roof had burnt through, and blazing fragments, falling
on to the landings below, had set fire to the walls and
the floors. Already the flames were eating away the
stairs, and Martin, groping his way up through the
smoke and by the aid of the banisters, was awakened
to realities by a sudden sharp stinging pain as his hand
touched a place that was on fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mounseer! Mounseer!” he called as he bounded up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached the landing at the top of the first flight.
Through the Frenchman’s open doorway, a little way
to the right, thick grey smoke was pouring. Moment
by moment red-hot splinters crashed down upon the
landing, and from above came the roar and crackle of
the devouring flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mounseer!” Martin shouted; then caught his
breath and coughed as the acrid smoke filled his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His smarting eyes streamed with water. Half
blinded, he pressed his lips firmly together and dashed
across the landing into the open doorway. The room
was thick with smoke: for a moment Martin was
compelled to close his eyes; when he opened them
again he saw flames bursting through the ceiling.
Part of a blazing rafter fell at his feet, and he staggered
back as innumerable sparks flew up in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mounseer! Mounseer!” he spluttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no sound but the ever-growing roar of the
flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Guessing from the denseness of the smoke that the
windows were closed, unable to see anything clearly,
Martin in desperation caught up a small stool which he
had touched with his feet and hurled it in the direction
of the window overlooking the waste ground at the
back. There was a crash of breaking glass; the smoke
began to pour out through the shattered pane, and
taking advantage of the immediate lightening of the
air Martin started to grope round the room in search of
the Frenchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stumbled against the table, knocked his shins
against the edge of the bed, felt across it with his hands:
there was no sign of Mounseer. Finding that he could
breathe more freely near the floor he dropped on his
hands and knees and began to crawl, wincing every
now and then as he touched a fragment of burning
wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made for the cupboard in the corner, thinking
that Mounseer might have been overpowered by the
smoke as he stood to save some of his few possessions
there. But there was no sign of him in the corner. He
worked back, and had almost completed the tour of
the room when, behind the door, he stumbled upon
something hard. It was the sole of a shoe. In another
moment he knew that the body of the Frenchman was
stretched along the floor close against the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raising himself, he seized Mounseer’s feet and tried
to drag him out upon the landing. But suddenly his
strength failed: overcome by the smoke he fell gasping
across the prostrate body, and lay for a few moments
in a state of collapse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Collecting himself with a great effort, he struggled to
his feet and managed to pull the inert form as far as
the doorway before once more faintness overtook him,
and again he fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to shout for help, but only a feeble croak
issued from his parched lips. A terrible fear assailed
him: if a few minutes’ immersion in the smoke could
rob him of his strength, how must it be with the
Frenchman, who had been so much longer exposed?
Was he too late? Was the old gentleman past
help?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought nerved him to one more effort. He
rose, and pulled with all his might at the Frenchman’s
legs. Staggering, he got him through the doorway on to
the landing. Here there was a little more air, but
Martin’s head swam; sick and dizzy he reeled, fell, and
struck his head against the banisters. At the moment
of his losing consciousness there was a noise in his
ears, above the roar of the flames—a noise as of people
shouting and running.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he came to himself he was lying in the roadway.
His head and chest were wet. His dazed, aching
eyes saw Susan Gollop bending over him; in the
background were other figures, among which he by and
by recognised that of George Hopton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mounseer!” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mounseer is safe, my lamb,” said Susan, her tone
unusually soft. “Take a drink: you’ll soon be all
right again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drank greedily from the cup she offered. A well-dressed
elderly gentleman came forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is recovering, mistress?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, sir, thank God!” replied Susan. “But I wish
Gollop would come. I don’t know what in the world
we are to do now. The old house is done for: we’ve
got our little bits of furniture here, but nowhere to
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t distress yourself, my good woman,” said the
gentleman. “I will make it my charge to look after
you all until something can be arranged. I would take
you to my own house were it not so far away; that is
impossible; but I will at once ride off to a farm I know
at Islington, where I make no doubt I can arrange for
your housing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crossed the road to where a boy was holding a
horse, mounted, and rode away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is that?” Martin murmured. George Hopton
came and stood by him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Greatorex, to be sure,” answered Susan, “and
a real kind gentleman. Brave too; ay, a man of bravery
if ever there was one, and quick of his mind. He came
riding up with this lad perched behind him, and the
way he got off that horse—well, ’twas a wonderful
spring for a man of his years. ‘Where’s Martin
Leake?’ he sings out. ‘In the house,’ says I, ‘a-saving
of the old gentleman on the first floor.’ ‘Isn’t there a
<span class='it'>man</span> that could have done that?’ says he, scornful-like,
looking round on the crowd. And I must own
they was an idle lot, all eyes and no sense. Well, he
didn’t wait a moment, but dashed into the house—though
I’ll own this lad was in front of him. My heart
was in my mouth when I saw ’em vanish into that
furnace and heard ’em shouting for you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mounseer! what of Mounseer?” asked Martin
again, as remembrance came to his dazed mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safe and sound, bless you,” replied Susan; “that
is, he will be, when he’s come to proper. He’s over
yonder, with a doctor looking after him. It seemed an
age before Mr. Greatorex came out again, though I
suppose ’twas no more than a minute or two. He had
you in his arms, and my heart went pit-a-pat that
dreadful when I saw your pale face and your poor
burnt hands. And behind him was this lad with
Mounseer on his back: a strong lad, and a good lad too.
And you hadn’t been out of the house two ticks when
the floors fell in with a terrible crash, and sparks flying
all across the street. ’Twas a merciful Providence that
sent Mr. Greatorex in the very nick of time to save you
from being burnt alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t understand—Mr. Greatorex—how—why
did he want me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can tell you that,” said Hopton. “I went up to
the shop to see if there was anything left of it. My
word! the ground did scorch my feet. Of course it’s
nothing but a black ruin: all Cheapside is burnt. I was
just coming away when Mr. Greatorex rode up. He’d
come up from the country; only think: the smoke and
bits of black paper and stuff have been carried forty or
fifty miles away. He asked me about Slocum, and
whether the goods had been saved in time; and then I
told him all I knew, and said that the goods were safe
on board the ship, and ’twas all owing to you. ‘Take
me at once to that Martin Leake,’ says he, and he was
in such a hurry that he made me get up on the saddle
behind him: first time in my life I’ve ever been on a
horse, and don’t I ache with the jolting! Then it
happened as Mrs. Gollop said: we found you and the old
Frenchman in a heap on the landing, and we weren’t
long bringing you out, I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And such foolishness of Mounseer!” said Susan.
“Nearly lost his life, and yours too, and what for?
Just for a bit of a box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A brass-bound box?” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, there’s no brass about it, so far as I could see,
though he kept it so tight in his arms that no one could
see it proper. He’d quite lost his senses when the lad
brought him out, but d’you think he’d let go of that
box? Not for ever so. He clung to it as if it was the
most vallyble thing in the whole world—just a bit of a
box, leather I fancy, but so old and worn that—there,
you never can tell what queer things some folks take a
fancy to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’s in the box?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, who’s to say? He’s got it in his arms still, and
there it’ll be until he’s rightly come to himself. Are
you feeling better now, my dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, though I’m rather chokey, and my hands
smart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure they do, and I’ve no oil to put on ’em.
But I’ll get some soon, and if Mr. Greatorex is a man
of his word—and I don’t say he isn’t—we’ll soon have
you in a comfortable bed in a farm-house, and milk and
cream, and—why, it’ll be a holiday in the country,
what I’ve wanted for years. You’ll like that, won’t
you, Lucy?” she asked, as the child ran up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mounseer’s opened his eyes,” said Lucy. “I’m so
glad. He smiled at me. And then he asked for Martin.
And then he said some funny words <span class='it'>I</span> couldn’t understand.
And then he told me to come and say ‘Thank
you’ a thousand times to Martin. That was just his
fun, of course, for I couldn’t say it so many times as
that, could I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just his foreign way, my dear,” said Susan.
“Once is enough with English people. Run back and
tell him that Martin is all right, and we’re all going to a
farm in the country. I do wish Gollop would come
home.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span><h1>CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SEVENTH</h1></div>

<h3>ALL’S WELL</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Not many hours later, in one of the comfortable rooms
of a large farm-house near the village of Islington,
Dick Gollop and his wife, Martin and Lucy and Gundra,
and Mounseer—whose name was Monsieur Raoul
Marie de Caudebec—had just finished the best meal
they had had for many a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Greatorex—proving himself to be a man of his
word—had sent them from the City in a hired coach,
and arranged that their furniture should follow in a
wagon. He himself had promised to come and see
them as soon as he had had an interview with one of
the sheriffs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The burns of Martin and the Frenchman had been
treated with oil and flour, and it was Susan Gollop’s
opinion that, except for a scar or two, they would
show no permanent marks of their recent terrible
experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I daresay Martin won’t show none at all,” she
said. “He’s young, and young skin has time to change
itself over and over again. And as to Mounseer—well,
he’s old, and I don’t suppose he’ll mind if he do
bear a blemish or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is philosophy, madam,” said the Frenchman
with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your box is marked worse than you,” Susan went
on, eyeing with simple curiosity the small leather
casket that lay on the table at Mounseer’s right hand.
“You can’t make a new thing of a bit of old leather,
specially when it’s had a thorough good scorching.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true, madam.” Mounseer laid his hand on
the casket. “It is old, older than I am; it was to my
grandfather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious me! Then it must be very ancient, for you
ain’t a chicken yourself. I don’t mean no offence,
Mounseer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure of that: it is just the English way. Eh
well, my friends, you have been so good to me that I
owe you to explain. One does not talk of the private
affairs until the time comes. This is the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he proceeded to relate a story that held the
rapt attention of his hearers. Escaping from persecution
in France, he had brought with him nothing but
his rapier and the casket that contained a number of
valuable jewels, heirlooms in his family. These were
his only means of support. One by one, as he needed
money, he had sold them to Mr. Slocum. His wants
being simple, he had made the money go a long way,
and he hoped that the contents of the casket would
last for the rest of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There now!” exclaimed Susan. “And you <span class='it'>would</span>
buy lollipops for Lucy! You didn’t ought to, Mounseer,
and I wouldn’t have allowed it if I’d known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so you would have robbed me of a great
pleasure,” said the old gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see it now,” said Martin. “You sold your jewels
from time to time to Slocum, and he knew how
valuable they were, though I don’t suppose he paid
you anything like what they were worth. And then he
had planned to rob Mr. Greatorex, and being greedy,
wanted the rest of your jewels as well. That explains
the attacks on your room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mounseer assented, adding that he had of course
never suspected Mr. Slocum of any part in those
attacks. Determined to protect his property, he had
removed a length of the wainscoting of the wall
of his room, and hidden the casket in the cavity
behind. When his room was ransacked, this hiding-place
remained undiscovered. He had only just removed
the casket when he was overcome by the
smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it is to you, my friend,” he said, turning to
Martin, “that I owe that I have still the means to
live; and when I die, if any of my jewels are left, they
shall be to you: I will so ordain it in my testament.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s handsome said,” cried Dick Gollop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I hope there will be none left,” said Martin,
flushing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning that you’ll live as long as Methusalem,
Mounseer,” said Susan. “And we all agree: of that I’m
very sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not covet so long a life,” said Mounseer, “but
it must be as the good God pleases.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, and what you can’t help, make the best of,”
said Gollop. “That Slocum and his crowd, now—their
course is set for the gallows, and I hope as they’ll put
a cheerful face on it. Nothing upsets me more than to
see a man draw down his chops when he’s on his way to
be hanged. He can’t get out of it, so his looks might
just as well be sweet as sour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day, when Mr. Greatorex paid his promised
visit to the farm, he brought some interesting news.
The man who called himself Seymour, but whose real
name was Smith, had purchased his freedom by
volunteering to turn King’s evidence, and had already
made a long statement. It appeared that the man
whom Martin had called Blackbeard was a brother of
Slocum, and had spent a good many years in piracy on
the eastern seas. He had captured Captain Leake’s
vessel the <span class='it'>Merry Maid</span>, made some few alterations in
her cut—not skilfully enough to deceive the sharp
eyes of Dick Gollop—changed her name to the <span class='it'>Santa
Maria</span>, and brought her into dock after a brush with
the French. He himself pretended to be a foreigner
and had assumed a foreign accent at times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meeting his brother after many years’ absence, he
had suggested that the most valuable articles in Mr.
Greatorex’s stock of plate and jewellery should be
gradually transferred to his vessel, carried to Portugal
and sold. Seymour had been admitted as a partner,
and had taken a lodging in the same house as the
Frenchman, partly because his room would be convenient
as a temporary storing place, and partly that
he might assist in the robbery of Mounseer’s valuables.
The outbreak of the Fire had enabled Slocum to carry off
the whole of the stock openly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Greatorex was loud in praise of Martin for the
large share he had had in saving the goods. He offered
to take him as a regular apprentice, but learning that
Martin had a passion for the sea, he agreed to place
him on a King’s ship, and promised to take charge of
Lucy. And being in want of a gardener for his country
house, he asked Gollop whether he would like to exchange
his constable’s staff for a spade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, I take it kind of you,” said Dick. “I
don’t mind if I do. I knows nothing about gardening,
but then I knowed nothing about the law till I took up
with it, and as a man of law I reckon I’ve a pretty good
name in London town. I’ll do my best, and if I ain’t
very good at it just at first, well, what <span class='it'>I</span> can’t help,
<span class='it'>you</span>'ll make the best of, I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It only remained to dispose of Gundra. Susan Gollop
undertook to give him a home until Martin should sail
on his first voyage to the East. Some two years later
Martin had the pleasure of restoring the boy to his
own family in Surat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slocum and his confederates were not destined to be
hanged after all. It was discovered one day that they
had broken prison, and they were never captured.
Years afterwards, when Martin was a captain in the

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
